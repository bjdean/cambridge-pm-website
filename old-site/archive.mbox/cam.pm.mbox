OK, finally got it working (at least with the version from 30 June); if
it helps anyone else, I had to create an `ext' subdirectory under the
main build directory to get things to work.

Let's see if I've grokked these correctly:

Just the same as Perl 5, apart from s/->/./g;

Pretty trivial :-)

As Perl 5, apart from array elements are now accessed with @, rather
than $ (what's being done about array slices? I'm sure I've seen
something on this somewhere...)

> | #!miniperl
> | @a=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8); $a=@a; print $a[0] ~ "\n";

`$a = @a' makes the scalar $a be a reference to the array @a, and $a[0]
then automatically dereferences that and takes the 0th element?

When are references automatically made and dereferenced?

ah, I haven't tried that version yet, it includes a new strict.pm, I think.

Indeed, the '.' as a dereference operator.

Absolutely

In Perl6 AIUI, any operation on an array will use the '@' tag.

so I can get

@b=@a[1..3];

should give me @b=(2,3,4);

as well as the example above.

Indeed.

> When are references automatically made and dereferenced?

When you said they are. The $a[0] syntax is unambiguous, because we know
that (ref($a) eq "ARRAY") will be true. Because we are *unambiguously* (now)
talking about the *::a{"SCALAR"}, then we can trivially see it is a
reference and can (automagically) dereference it to give the result.

It only makes them more readable.  They're still an abomination.  $/ and
$$ are about the only ones I ever use, although I have had occasion to use $,
and $>, as in snippets like the following:

  ($user, undef, $uid, undef) = getpwuid($>);

Oops.  I've just spotted a bug in that.  The regexp should be /^$user$/.

If you say so.  :-)

$_ has all sorts of horrible magic associated with it though, doesn't it?
Things like foreach automatically localize it, for example.  I'm not
surprised if it behaves oddly in other contexts as well.  It's another
thing I avoid using apart from in very small inner loops, where it's
obvious what sort of thing $_ is.

$$ is useful. $/ is very useful if you're playing with record-like files.
I occasionally use $., which is the current record number. $> and $< are
also useful, as they allow you to do the userid operations. I occasionally
use $_ too, $0, occasionally, and often $!.[1]

No. Builtin functions will often try to use $_ if they can't find other
arguments. There's no real magic associated with it. There's also no "magic"
in the perl sense, either, IIRC.

That's not magic. That's using local.

using it with map is probably my main use.

MBM

[1] for those who don't know and can't be bothered to look it up:
    $$ - process id
    $/ - record separator, useful with <filehandle> operators
    $. - current record number
    $> - effective uid
    $) - effective gid
    $< - real uid
    $( - real gid
    $_ - erm. well, too many meanings
    $0 - the argv[0] of this script
    $! - errno or strerror(errno)

Which I do.  A lot.  FASTA format nucleic sequence database?

local $/ = "\n>";

SWISSPROT-style protein databases?

local $/ = "\n//\n";

Indeed.

$fh->open("<foo") or die "Could not open foo : $!\n";

Oh, I see.  Is that to stop the $ in $user being interpreted in the
usual regexp way?  None of our users have perl metacharacters in their
user IDs, but I suppose it doesn't hurt to be safe.

Yes, but it's using local without your explicitly asking for it.  I call
that magic.

I only just started using map.  Can't imagine why I overlooked it before
- stunningly useful!

Absolutely - I hadn't thought of doing that with open... That's very neat.

Indeed. :-)

I often use it for dereferencing things:

 $foo= [
         {
           bar => "d",
           baz => "f" 
         },
         {
           bar => "a",
           baz => "b" 
         },
         {
           bar => "z",
           baz => "x" 
         }
       ];
@z = map { $_->{"bar"} } @$foo;

Ah, I've never been very fond of this one, I'd prefer my own output to be
explicitly what I ask for, but then TMTOWTDI. :-)

Thinking about map has just enabled me to write an absolute gem.  A
routine to translate DNA sequence into its protein equivalent using
three lines of code and one lookup table:

my %convert = ( "AAA", "K", "AAC", "N", "AAG", "K", "AAT", "N",
		"ACA", "T", "ACC", "T", "ACG", "T", "ACT", "T",
		"AGA", "R", "AGC", "S", "AGG", "R", "AGT", "S",
		"ATA", "I", "ATC", "I", "ATG", "M", "ATT", "I",
		
		"CAA", "Q", "CAC", "H", "CAG", "Q", "CAT", "H",
		"CCA", "P", "CCC", "P", "CCG", "P", "CCT", "P",
		"CGA", "R", "CGC", "R", "CGG", "R", "CGT", "R",
		"CTA", "L", "CTC", "L", "CTG", "L", "CTT", "L",
		
		"GAA", "E", "GAC", "D", "GAG", "E", "GAT", "D",
		"GCA", "A", "GCC", "A", "GCG", "A", "GCT", "A",
		"GGA", "G", "GGC", "G", "GGG", "G", "GGT", "G",
		"GTA", "V", "GTC", "V", "GTG", "V", "GTT", "V",
		
		"TAA", "*", "TAC", "Y", "TAG", "*", "TAT", "Y",
		"TCA", "S", "TCC", "S", "TCG", "S", "TCT", "S",
		"TGA", "*", "TGC", "C", "TGG", "W", "TGT", "C",
		"TTA", "L", "TTC", "F", "TTG", "L", "TTT", "F" ) ;

sub translate {
  my $seq = uc(shift);
  my @codons = $seq =~ /\G.../g;
  join('', map { $convert{$_} || 'X' } @codons);
}

I'm quite pleased with that.  :-)  There are probably faster but more
long-winded methods though.

I have C code to do the same thing which is a couple of hundred lines
long (although it does use various tricks to translate all six reading
frames simultaneously - the above routine only translates the first
forward frame).

Ooh, I can go home a happy man today.

Tim.

Firstly, as a style thing (especially for hashes), can I recommend '=>' as
a synonym for ',' ('=>' also has the nice side effect of quoting the word
to its left)

ie 

my %convert = ( AAA => "K", AAC => "N", AAG => "K", AAT => "N"
...

> sub translate {

That's an interesting way of writing that, I'd have probably done

my @codons = split /(...)/, $seq;

or

my @codons=();
push(@codons, substr($seq,0,3)), $seq=substr($seq,3) while length $seq;

Not sure, though...

That's pretty neat.

Not sure. That's going to be pretty fast with the hash lookup.

OK. This bit is a bit beyond me... Although, I can imagine with the memory
allocation etc, the C would have to be bigger.

Cool. :-)

Hello Happy Cam.pers!

A lot of the perlish stuff I do involves web-based access to SQL
databases. I use the CGI and DBI modules, and am pretty happy with them.

There are four things that I am missing:

  a wrapper function which sprintfs correctly $dbh->quoted() arguments
  into a query string

  wrapper functions for sql queries which return single values, etc

  a 2 dimensional SQL result -> 2 dimensional HTML table + style system

  a SQL table schema -> CGI form system


I plead ignorance. Does any of these things actually exist?

Mk

While I of course agree that Perl is the only choice for your task, I think
that you're being a _bit_ unfair on C. Here's a first pass:

typedef struct { char *from; char to; } Table;

Table convert[] = {{"AAA", 'K'}, {"AAC", 'N'}, {"AAG", 'K'}, {"AAT", 'N'},
		   {"ACA", 'T'}, {"ACC", 'T'}, {"ACG", 'T'}, {"ACT", 'T'},
		   {"AGA", 'R'}, {"AGC", 'S'}, {"AGG", 'R'}, {"AGT", 'S'},
		   {"ATA", 'I'}, {"ATC", 'I'}, {"ATG", 'M'}, {"ATT", 'I'},
		   
		   {"CAA", 'Q'}, {"CAC", 'H'}, {"CAG", 'Q'}, {"CAT", 'H'},
		   {"CCA", 'P'}, {"CCC", 'P'}, {"CCG", 'P'}, {"CCT", 'P'},
		   {"CGA", 'R'}, {"CGC", 'R'}, {"CGG", 'R'}, {"CGT", 'R'},
		   {"CTA", 'L'}, {"CTC", 'L'}, {"CTG", 'L'}, {"CTT", 'L'},
                
		   {"GAA", 'E'}, {"GAC", 'D'}, {"GAG", 'E'}, {"GAT", 'D'},
		   {"GCA", 'A'}, {"GCC", 'A'}, {"GCG", 'A'}, {"GCT", 'A'},
		   {"GGA", 'G'}, {"GGC", 'G'}, {"GGG", 'G'}, {"GGT", 'G'},
		   {"GTA", 'V'}, {"GTC", 'V'}, {"GTG", 'V'}, {"GTT", 'V'},
                
		   {"TAA", '*'}, {"TAC", 'Y'}, {"TAG", '*'}, {"TAT", 'Y'},
		   {"TCA", 'S'}, {"TCC", 'S'}, {"TCG", 'S'}, {"TCT", 'S'},
		   {"TGA", '*'}, {"TGC", 'C'}, {"TGG", 'W'}, {"TGT", 'C'},
		   {"TTA", 'L'}, {"TTC", 'F'}, {"TTG", 'L'}, {"TTT", 'F'},

		   {"XXX", 'X'}};

char *translate(char *from) {
  char *c, *ans = (char *)calloc(1, strlen(from) / 3 + 1);
  int i, j, done;

  for (c = from, j = 0; *c && *(c + 1) && *(c + 2); c += 3) {
    for (i = 0, done = 0; !done; i++) {
      if ((*c == convert[i].from[0] && *(c + 1) == convert[i].from[1] &&
	   *(c + 2) == convert[i].from[2]) || convert[i].from[0] == 'X') {
	ans[j++] = convert[i].to;
	done = 1;
      }
    }

  return(ans);

eg:

Well, some are trivial to write yourself, others I have yet to find an
implementation of that I like, and that works in every situation (by which
I mean that I have some way of tweaking it if it doesn't work).

To avoid the

    $sql_statement = sprintf( "INSERT INTO users VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %S)",
                              	$dbh->quote( $a ),
				$dbh->quote( $b ),
				$dbh->quote( $c ),
				$dbh->quote( $d ) );

Even with map { $dbh->quote( $_ ) } ( $a, $b, $c, $d ) it's still klunky.

All of these things are pretty easy to write; the issue for me is that I
don't to cut and paste the code from project to project, I want it in a
proper perl module written by someone who understands writing perl modules
which I can apt-get or download from CPAN, and I want it out there so that
there's just one fewer hurdle to getting things done for people trying to
write the sorts of applications which require this functionality. 

I guess I should probably start writing my own perl module then.

sorry, namespace overload: by query string, I thought you meant
scalar($r->args) or $ENV{"QUERY_STRING"} (depending on your orientation).

how about:

| $sql="INSERT INTO users VALUES (?,?,?,?)";
| my $sth=$dbh->prepare($sql);
|
| $sth->execute($a,$b,$c,$d);

?? which is a standard in the DBI implementation, and is sometimes well
implemented in databases which do query cacheing (eg Oracle, Informix)

Personally, I'd write a library of your own to do this, I know this sounds
like reinventing the wheel, but the different exceptions that can be raised
etc, make this a problem where everybody's idea of a good solution will be
different. In my example above, you can't tell the difference between no
row, and an invalid sql query, so a different implementation, which should
be run in eval{} is.

sub get_single {
    my $dbh=shift;
    my $sql=shift;

    my $sth=$dbh->prepare($sql);
    if(!$sth) {
        die "Couldn't prepare \`$sql'\n";
    }
    if($sth->execute(@_)) {
        if($sth->rows) {
            my($ret)=$sth->fetchrow_array();
            $sth->finish();
            return $ret;
        }
        die "No rows returned\n";
    }
    $sth->finish();
    die "Query \`$sql' failed\n";
}

This gives you better exception handling. You may want this, you may not.

after all, you could then write a wrapper that does:

sub get_single_wrapper {
    my $ret;
    if(eval {$ret=get_single(@_);1;}) {
        return $ret;
    } else {
        mail_admin("SQL query failed: $_[1] from ".caller(), $@);
        return undef;
    }
}

or you may want it to completely change the template, (eg, in development,
come up with an "it failed here" kind of template, which then prints the
text of the die...)

Oh, definitely, there just doesn't seem to be any nice way of doing it, I've
seen some attempts with php etc, but certainly if you have a database that
doesn't enforce referential integrity(, then you deserve to lose anyway, but)
then you have other problems here.

Very much so. :-)

Bear in mind that designing good interfaces is decidedly non-trivial. Spend
some time first thinking about the limitations of the way that you've chosen
to do things, and see if there's any way to make sure it can handle 100% of
cases, even if some of them take a bit more work...

What if I want
"INSERT INTO users (username, password, snood, offog) VALUES (%s, %s, %s,
%s)"?

What is referential integrity (I Am Not A Compsci) and how is it relevant
here?

Strangely, I am already aware of that.

"INSERT INTO users (username, password, snood, offog) VALUES (?,?,?,?)"
and the same thing.

see also foreign keys. Where you want to make sure that an id (which should
be a key in another table) actually exists in the other table. And that if
you delete the entry, then everything that refers to it is also deleted, or
that the operation is blocked until nothing refers to it.

Not that I am aware of, but have a look at a few, also try running h2xs

Yes, indeed, it's possible to write a fairly short C version like that,
but it's quite slow owing to a large amount of conditional code.  It
also only translates one reading frame.

The long code I was talking about translates all six reading frames in a
single pass.  It's pretty ugly, but those who are interested will find
it in the file translate.c in my tpatterns program, which you can
download from:

http://www.cyclin.demon.co.uk/software/tpatterns

It includes such lovely bits of code as:

  for (n = 0; n<64; n++)
    {
      r = (~((n & 0x0C) |
	  ((n & 0x03) << 4) |
	  ((n >> 4) & 0x03))) & 0x3F;

      ((char *)dest)[r] = ((char*)source)[n];

    }

You'll have to look at the original if you want to know what that's for.
The original is commented.  :-)

Some of the loops are unrolled, too, which makes it longer.

Tim.

I'm probably missing something here, but why does the following:

--- cut here ---
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;

use Data::Dumper;
use IO::File;

my @array = ( "foo", "bar" );

my $fh = new IO::File( "> /dev/stdout" ) or die "Couldn't open: $!";

print $fh Data::Dumper->Dump( \@array );

$fh->close or die "Couldn't close: $!";
--- cut here ---

give me:

Bareword found where operator expected at ./bar.pl line 13, near "$fh Data::Dumper"
        (Missing operator before Data::Dumper?)

Cheers,

Phil

should be

print $fh ( Data::Dumper->Dump( \@array ) );

It's to do with the weird printing to filehandles "no comma" syntax perl
has, I believe. Note that it's not print( $fh foo ) or print( $fh, foo ).

So why doesn't

print $fh Dumper( \@array );

give a warning? I'm just confused as to why sometimes I get the warning
(try something like print $fh ::function_in_package_main; ) and
sometimes I don't...

Hi peeps.  I've been busy and you've all gone quiet.  To keep it vaguely
on topic, this is rather amusing - can anyone say CAPSA?

Some of the list members seem to be familiar with the planned direction of
perl6... can anyone tell me whether it will have anything like C's

Why do you need structs when you've got objects?

All I know about Perl 6 is in Larry's "Apocalypses" at
  http://www.perl.com/pub/au/Wall_Larry
Does anyone know any more?

I assume Class::Struct will get ported at some stage (not that I've ever
used it).

Compile-time checking that you're accessing valid property names,
rather than run time?

As Lucy pointed out when I asked this question, there's also Damien
Conway's Exegesis 2 (there is no Exegesis 1):

http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/05/08/exegesis2.html

and his talk to YAPC::NA:

Have a look at dev.perl.org.  I think RFC 122 is what you're after.  BTW,
anyone up for putting some theory into practice[1] and have a meet up?

As an amateur historian of internet-mediated social groupings and

Unless I'm very much mistaken, the way to get objects in perl is to bless
a reference to a hash and have that hash's keys "do the Right Thing" when
used as accessor/member functions, and I'd prefer it if the whole notion
were just built into the syntax.

you can bless() any reference.

I'm not sure that I follow what you mean here. The OO idea is that the
object methods act on *this object*. So bless() and the -> syntax is all
you need for OO programming. Of course, "real" OO languages provide ways
to keep some of the internals of an object class private (and this is
actually possible in Perl, though slightly horrid syntactically[1]), and
Perl doesn't make this easy.

However, there's no reason that you need to bless a hashref, it just happens
to be easiest to do it that way.

I'm not sure I follow what you mean here. The -> syntax is part of Perl.

bless($ref, $package) basically says:
   if I use $ref in a syntax with $ref->function(@args) then execute
   &{$package."::function"}($ref,@args)

    (disclaimer: I don't have a copy to hand, and I actually prefer not to

   the idea being that the method1 and method2 don't appear directly in

                   OK, I did get it wrong.
                   Although I think there may be some horriblenesses with this.

Ignore this.

You can still get private methods for an individual sub by defining them
within that sub, but then they're not necessarily useful, as you can't get
at them from another sub within the class... :-(

And many "real" OO languages provide strong static typechecking, which I
think is what Martin wants. Unfortunately static tyepchecking is anathema
to Perl..

As MBM has managed to show, you can almost get this sort of thing with
closures, but it's hard to get right and not a "natural" syntactic
idiom. I keep meaning to look more at CLOS (Common Lisp Object System), as
it seems to do the right stuff.

Let's think of a suitable idiom and work out the implementation later :)

Nah, I just want sane syntax for my variables: $employee.hoopiness = 12;
I don't give a damn about the type checking; I'm actively against it. I
want to be able to create a new attribute on the fly.

"Hey you sass that hoopy frood Martin Keegan? ..."

$employee.knowledge_of_location_of_towel anyone?

This, in perl6 would (I think) denote a method call, but from perl5.5, you
have a syntax which allows you to write accessors in this way:

sub :lvalue AUTOLOAD { ... }

right. you might, in this case have to think about doing:

$employee.{'hoopiness'} = 12;

This'd definitely work... although, you can use the autoload to make any
unknown methods into auto hash keys...

This is precisely what I want to avoid. I've written some MUDs in perl and
they all rely heavily on the AUTOLOAD hack to give me structs. I fail to
see why I need to execute a whole Menge of code just to get subobnoxious
syntax for non-scalar structures.

I think she's already gone - didn't she mention she was leaving for
Copenhagen yesterday or today?

Oops. I guess not next weekend, then, but the one after (4th August).

Hi,

I've just subscribed to the list, so I thought I'd say hello before =
settling back and lurking quietly in the shadows.

I'm still pretty much a Perl beginner and I have to do most of my Perl in =
my spare time as my real job is C programming for DSPs, the big difference =
is that you don't usually debug Perl with an oscilloscope!

I can often be found hanging around at http://www.perlmonks.org and I have =
a personal homepage at http://www.koshka1.demon.co.uk.=20

Bye for now,
Kevin.

Since Lucy (our great leader) is apparently away, I guess it could be
said to fall to me to welcome you and everybody else who has subscribed
recently.

"The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with 
 judiciously placed print statements." - Brian Kernighan, 1978

(shamelessly nicked from simon c's sigfile. :-)

I'm trying to picture how one could apply that to an oscilloscope. :-)

we need to do something about the cam.pm webpages, I guess we will once
we've done our first meet[1]... :-)

On that subject...

sub UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD{ $UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD =~ s/::/ /; print
"$UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD "}; hacker perl another just;

Anyone willing to give me some hints on how that one works?

UNIVERSAL is a special package, it provides the base function.

so, if no package is specified, it will try ::AUTOLOAD and then
UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD.

so, reformatting:

| sub UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD {
|     $UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD =~ s/::/ /;
|     print "$UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD ";
| }
| 
| hacker perl another just;

the value of $UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD will be (like every other autoloader)
the name of the function: (in this case, potentially, ::just ::another, etc).

we parse this as

| hacker(perl(another(just())));

This needs to be evaluated as just() another(just()) perl(another(just())) and
the above expression.

Hence: just another perl hacker

Does that help?

Do we?

I tried:

| sub UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD {
|     die "$UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD";
| }
| 
| hacker perl another just;

which gave:

$ perl japh.pl
cass26:pak:~/tmp$ perl japh.pl 
just::another at japh.pl line 2.

where as using the bracketed form hacker(perl(another(just()))) gives:

$ perl japh.pl
cass26:pak:~/tmp$ perl japh.pl 
main::just at japh.pl line 2.

This is where I got confused :-) (In fact, using the
`hacker(perl(another(just()))))' form in the original program gives an
output of `main just main another main perl main hacker', which I

Is this something to do with indirect objects again?

The debug terminal output is usually one of the first things to die on the =
DSP, so instead of print statements you twiddle I/O lines or flash LEDs.

I'm sure it's good training  in debugging, but it's not much fun!

No. Further experimentation:
| [mbm@colon]:~$ perl
| a b c d ;
| Can't locate object method "c" via package "d" at - line 1.

so for some reason, it's parsing this as
| b::a( b, d::c( d ) )

(I wrote everything else before, but: )It's the hack that allows "new" to
be like a keyword.

sort of.

fair enough.

I don't know. I like debugging - but mostly when I get somewhere with it.

I guess it's a personal thing, though...

YA Empire House AICMFP. I'm wondering about DSL, looking at my dad's setup
(at his office) the 40/mth offering seems to actually emulate a modem
over the USB, so you dial "0", and then bring up the PPP connection. I'm
starting to wonder how hard it can be under *BSD or Leegnux. WaveLAN is
utterly cool. My dad has just bought a Titanium laptop and an AirPort, and
I was tasked with getting it working. I borrowed an Orinico card too. It
works a treat, it's particularly cool printing something on a printers
halfway across the room, when you're sitting at a table with no wires on
the laptop.

I'd use the external cards, though, because they actually work, the
signal attenuation on the Titanium was quite scary...

> geekhaus?  And don't you just love foreign keyboards...  

I always have trouble with the computer of one of the sysadmins at work
who just has a uk-layout keyboard, with a us map.

MBM (not amazingly fond of laptop keyboards, although likes his shiny
     new laptop).

I'm simply not going to move into my new place if it doesn't have NTL
cable (and they can't tell me for a few days, annoyingly). Ultimately in
an ideal world, ucam.adverts.accommodation ads will all come stating
whether the house is NTL cablemodem installation compliant, though in my
ideal world the Keegan government would probably have outlawed the
Internet just to be on the safe side.

 That's the traditional form.

 The swedish keymap is actually quite nice in some areas (although the
<> are quite awkward).  OTOH I use a non-standard map anyway.

 This lapto-keyboard isn't bad, although the keys are a bit soft.  The
main problem I have with it though i that the right-hand side is all
wrong (like most PC keyboards).

Who administers this list? It's common, and helpful, with mailing lists, to
add a tag in square brackets at the beginning of the subject line. I wonder
if the Powers That Be could consider this? :-)

OK. I'll wait until 4pm and if I get more 'aye's than 'nay's then I'll turn

Oh...I forgot it was only Monday.  I meant the next 2 weeks after this
one.  I'm s'posed to be beer festival-ing in London - <plug>www.gbbf.org</> -
for the rest of this week.  Tho' at this rate I'm not gonna make it...

Two things I forgot to say last post:
* cam.pm is nice compared to london.pm from which I've had to withdraw
whilst Getting Stuff Done[tm]
* Er....Actually, I can't remember what the other thing was.  Might've
had summat to do with YAPC.

Matthew: re BOSC/ISMB, they've been and gone, which is where I was last
week, but I can provide reports if required.

I'm certainly curious about this, and its possible that other people will
be too. Personally, where these conferences involve perl, we're able to
feel like there's some point to cam.pm in terms of idea transfer etc if

Please do post some kind of report.

Icelandic, they also use =D0 and =F0 (eth?), as far as I could tell they =
sound the same as thorn.

Icelandic travel tip #1: Don't try the rotted shark (hakarl (sp?)), your =
mouth will never forgive you.  Think about it, back at home would you eat =
something that had been buried in gravel for nine months?

Just a reminder:
* Friday Aug 3, sometime in the evening
  Castle, Castle Hill.

I'm not sure what time I'll be there, because I work in London, but I'm
certainly going to be up there at some point in the evening.

Oh. I sort of thought that one had died a death...

I may have two other things to do this evening now, but I should be able
to stick my head in at some stage... (at least one of the events will
continue after closing... http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/~grads/vacbar/

I thought we'd cancelled it because Lucy couldn't make it? Or did I imagine
that? Anyway, I can't make it any more.

Obviously I'm confused then. OK. We'll have to rearrange a meet. :-/ Damn.
Requires organisation. :-)

Confooslement due to me being crap.  So I *will* be in Cambridge tonight
due to being knackered/not feeling 100% so as long as someone else says
they'll turn up I'll be in the Castle from...ooh, about 6.30 ish or when I
get bored of not-working.  Though I'll probably be sticking to the cold,
fizzy, caffeinated stuff.  Email me if you want my mobile no.  Crash space
available.


L.
As long as no one snitches on me to CAMRA.

Stop the world, I want to get off!  My prior arrangement for August 10th
has been cancelled, so how about then?  If anyone's bored tonight, mail me.

Next Friday is OK with me. But don't let me stop you all having a pub meet
tonight too if you want.

OK... is the current position that not a lot is happening (cam.pm-wise)
this evening, but we're having a meet next week? If so, that sounds
pretty good to me :-)

There'll be people in the pub tonight ('cos it's Friday), but given the
confusion we'll say next week is 'official'.  Sound sensible?

I think the difference is the same as the difference between the `th'

This shall be in The Castle Inn, Castle Hill on Friday the 10th from about
7ish, though feel free to arrive early or whenever you knock off work.  There
is every likelihood that Randal L Schwartz - co-author of the beloved llama
book - will be joining us.

On another note, the residents of House! seem to have spent a large majority
of the weekend seeing who can compose the most smutty verse out of my perl
fridge magnets.  Still awaiting final results.

Cool... I'm coming back from Durham that day, but should be back in
Cambridge by about 4pm (modulo GNER and WAGN).

Anyone got any experience with this?  I'm trying to speed some scripts
up by balancing the fluffiness of perl with the efficiency of C.

And why do Amazon include Web Caching by Duane Wessels in the children's category?

There are details on http://cam.pm.org/meets.shtml which answers some of your
questions.

Assuming you're driving up, I'd recommend junction 13 on the M11,
turn right when you come off the motorway, and that gets you into north
Cambridge avoiding a lot of hassle. However, I'd hope at this point that
someone in Cambridge (I'm within trebuchet range of the Tower of London)
will at this point pipe up with how the traffic restrictions and parking
works round there.

However, I was planning on going up by train, which gives me about a 30
minute walk from Cambridge station to the pub.

The following is shorter and probably more obvious:

sub translate {

  s/(...)/($convert{$1} || 'X')/eg;
  return $_;
}

Needs elaboration.

* The Castle Inn on Castle Street (not to be confoosled with The Castle on
St Andrew's St) is halfway up the only hill[1] in Cambridge at the
northwest corner of the city centre.

* The nearest multistorey is Park Street, though you can probably use
parking space at the council's offices at the top of the hill.  Also beware
that Cambridge has a strange one way system and pedestrianised bits - I don't
drive so I can't comment further.

* Extensive 'research' last week indicates that it should be hopefully quiet
(or at least until we get there) and we're likely to be upstairs.  Look out
for the camel/orangutan, depending on which of my stuffed animals is feeling
most sociable.  As 'responsible organiser' I'll aim to get there early (6ish)
and make sure the beer is up to scratch.  In case of emergenices, ring 07939
476024.

* See www.cammap.com - dontcha just love a clickety-map which shows the
pubs?

Junction 13 sounds fine. Once you get into Cambridge from there there's
a roundabout at which you turn left onto Northampton Street, and then
left from there onto Castle Hill. There's car parking on your right at
the top of the hill, just after the pub, where you should be able to
find some space.

(And after all that I'll be at HAL2001 and won't be able to meet Randal
and co. Oh well.)

Alternatively, I think there is usually parking in the streets behind the
west side of Castle Street. It's slightly unintuitive how to get there
though. This map might help:

http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v2/drawmap.cgi?mp=main;xx=1500;yy=240;sz=3;tl=;mt=;ms=40;mh=40;mw=4;mo=10;ma=0;mx=1900;my=1040;db=0;gf=png;tp=map.ttml

You have to go down the very first bit of the road marked A1134 (which is
not one way), then down Shelly Road, and then St Peters Street without
getting sucked into Albion Row.

Hmmm, maybe the other idea was better after all. :-)

You might want to know that...

       The => digraph is mostly just a synonym for the comma
       operator.  It's useful for documenting arguments that come
       in pairs.  As of release 5.001, it also forces any word to
       the left of it to be interpreted as a string.

...leading to a sometimes clearer way of writing out lists that are
going to become hashes:

    %hash = ( key1 => "value1",
              key2 => "value2",
              key3 => "value3",
            );

(The trailing comma is there for a reason - it eliminates a boring
change from diff output if you add extra elements.)

Just a reminder that Cam.pm will be having it's first social meet tonight
at the Castle Inn, Castle Street (the one and only hill), Cambridge.
We'll be kicking off about 7ish, though feel free to turn up early and
help me test the beer, and (barring emergencies) will be joined by Mr
Randal Schwartz.

He's greg, you'll get used to it. :-) There is http://jouke.perlmonk.org/YAPC

I would have been able to drink more, if I hadn't spent half the evening
trying to avoid you putting nail varnish on my fingernails, face etc. :-) oh
and not being asked about BSD kernel configuration and spodding.. :-) We
probably should have tried to organise WaveLAN from the colony, though, one
for next time, I suspect. :-)

That's when I get round to getting the evidence developed - if it turns out. 
<grin>. But then we can always fake it - and he's coming back in November 
hopefully...

Good to meet all you guys (including the pikers) on Friday - I'm trying to 
stir Cambridge PM up to challenge London PM to a drinking match since I reckon 
they'd be put under the table easily. MBM is the only one who's bitten so far 
- reckon he just wants to compete with himself (or do you guys say play with 
yourself in England??)

Thought I'd do I quick summary to save sending lots of replies to the
list.  And nope, I'm not avoiding work.  Much.

* I think I can safely say the social on Friday night was a success.
About 20 people in total turned up - including many non-subscribers who
we managed to twist the arms of - and we crammed into the top floor of the
Castle between 2 other reserved tables (might try that trick for next
time).

* Randal was safely delivered into our company by my boss's boss (hence my
boss's cross-examination of me this morning) at around 9.30.  Incidentally,
reports from my spies at the Genome Informatics meeting at Hinxton say
Randal talked about how perl 6 development has been organised and that they
were going to change everything and get it done in 2 years.

* When MBM let him get a word in edgeways, Randal gave us a slide show from
his Stonehenge trip on Thursday, we all signed a random bit of paper (for lack
of beer mats) and he promised to come back in November.  Possibly.  I can't
remember the details of the rest due to people buying me beer.


And in other news:
* We now have about 35 subscribers, including digests.  For comparison,
london.pm recently celebrated their 3rd birthday and have about 300.
* Jonathan has volunteered to do summat with the web site...cheers.
* London.pm, via Sue, have challenged us to a drinking contest

  Fridays tend to be pre-empted by lots of other things, though, at least in
my statistical analysis of these things called "lives" that people I know
seem to have more and more often these days.  Myself I tend to be in a train
to Swansea many Fridays. Therefore Fridays are counterindicated.

Yeah, right, you expect me to believe that?

Maybe we should have a meet every 13 days. (Or some other number coprime
to 7, who invited the mathematician along anyway? :-)

They don't just need Damians. It appears that Damian is helping Larry a lot
with the language design, but he's not doing any of the underlying
implementation. We probably need to clone lots more Dan Susalskis, and I'd
guess that a few more Jarkkos wouldn't go amiss.

Anyway, Damian is Australian, Jarkko is Finnish, so hopefully there shouldn't
be a problem with them.

  I've not filled mine with M&Ms yet.  I want an appropriately flexible
straw so that I can drink apple brandy out of it.

Apparently "the winner may be judged on accuracy, precision, creativity,
rhyming & meter, basal metabolism, or some other criteria" so I
challeng you dedicated perlmongers to win Cam.pm a Klein bottle.

Considering that that the shipping costs are

* Packing & shipping to Europe (via Postal Air Small Packet / Airmail)
* $13 to ship the first bottle
* $3 to ship each prime-numbered bottle (2nd, 3rd, 5th, etc)
* Free shipping for all other bottles (4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, etc).

maybe the Klein bottle deprived among us considering rectifying this by
purchasing said bottles should club together to reduce postage.

My social schedule is sufficiently flexible[1] that I can make most
days; Fridays would tend to clash with other typical Friday night-type
things, though.

OTOH, Fridays may well be easier for any non-actually-resident in
Cambridge types.

How often? Hmmm... IIRC, london.pm does monthly meets, which doesn't
seem like a bad idea to me.

I often seem to be leaving Cambridge on Fridays[1].  I'd vote for Wednesdays
as being more feasible to get to, especially as on a monthly-meet basis I
could easily always be away on the particular Friday of the month.

Hello one and all.

I've got a Perl script that needs to parse a LALR(1) language. In C I'd use
lex and yacc, what's the best way to do this in Perl? I realise that there
are other weird parsing methods more suited to perl (like bag grammars, and
so on) but it would be nice if there was something that would just take a
BNF grammar and do the right thing. Is there something people can
recommend in the standard distribution or on CPAN?

Dan.

There isn't, as far as I know, an LALR parser out of the box, however, if
you have a BNF that could be rewritten to Recursive Descent instead, there
is Parse::RecDescent by the complete nutcase^W^W^WDamian Conway. That's on
CPAN. I'm not aware of any LALR(1) equivalent, though.

http://search.cpan.org/ may or may not be your friend.

:-)

Beware that the code on CPAN is of *very* variable quality, you may want to
have a quick look at the code for things before actually linking them in...

I typed "yacc perl" into Google.

1) The Perl FAQ says...

http://language.perl.com/faq/v2/Q3.3.html

  Is there a yacc for Perl?

  Yes!! It's a version of Berkeley yacc that outputs Perl code instead
  of C code! You can get this from
  ftp://ftp.sterling.com/local/perl-byacc1.8.2.tar.Z, or send the
  author mail for details.

...but the link doesn't work for me.  You might be able to track down
an alternative copy by googling or digging around mirrors.  (Does
archie still work?)

2) At http://perl.plover.com/py/ you will find a GPL'd program which
   uses Bison to do the hard work and eventually produces something
   usable from Perl.

I hunted for the mysterious perl-emitting YACC parser, but only found a
number of broken links. Perhaps it's out there somewhere. OTOH, I've just
had a perverted idea of how to do parsing to at least Type II with s///'s.

Unfortunately the grammar I have won't turn into recursive descent or
operator pecedence parsable forms. Whivch is a shame because I've got a
perl parser for each of those lying around. :)

There's a Debian package of it:

http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/perl-byacc.html

The source code is linked from the above page, if nowhere else.

Hi Guys,

I thought I'd pick your brains for tips on jobhunting here. 
I'm looking for Unix Sysadmin CONTRACT work so I'm kinda forced to go through 
the agencies since the big companies don't seem to want contractors or have 
incredibly slack HR departments.

Thought I had it down pat from last time - just blast away applying for 
anything on jobserver/go jobsite, etc.
Do these guys actually read their email???

I have 7 years experience and heaps of skills so I "shouldn't" have trouble 
finding something.

But I've had one real phone call in the last week and one email. The rest are 
people trying to get you to do permanent work.

Any ideas for approaches, good agencies, good websites? 
I'm getting SOOOO bored not working!!

Cheers,

Sue

Unfortunately I think you're going to find that the UK IT job market is quite
depressed at the moment - a lot of places are making staff redundant and are
cutting back on the number of contractors they are taking on. For example in
the company I work for (large US ISP/telco with offices on the Science park)
had an edict come down from on high (ie the US) at the beginning of the year
saying that all contractors were not to have their contracts re-newed. We've
also been in a hiring freeze since then as well. This is something which is
going to continue for at least another 5-6 months thanks to the recent
redundancies as well.

Another example is from the banking sector - apparently one back has just let
half of its contractors go and made the remaining half take a 10% cut in pay.

I also know of a number of Unix contracting companies who have around half of
their staff looking for new contracts.

However I've heard that Kent is quite a hot-bed of Solaris work WRT
contracting. As is Vienna.

Sorry that this is not the sort of answer you were looking for.

Hi Sue,

Welcome to the UK in the middle of the biggest jobs recession
for some time :(

I've not looked for a contract since the end of last year but
there are others on the list who can tell you that it's pretty
grim out there in the contract market right now.

I usually use joberve.com to find leads, but I've found that
most of the jobs listed on there are fakes planted there to harvest
CVs. I've also found that most agents are incapable of replying
to an email. You _have_ to follow up your initial email with
a call to stand any chance of them dealing with you[1].

But the story that I'm hearing from everywhere is that the contract
market is almost completely stagnant. The few companies that
are taking on staff are trying to get permies.

Having said that, if you've got good skills then there's no reason
why _someone_ shouldn't want to take you on. Even as a contractor.
It's probably just a case of being tenacious.

And making those calls.

hth,

Dave...

[1] And on more than once occasion that call has consisted of
me leading the agent thru how to install Acrobat Reader so he
can read my CV[2]. 

[2] Yes, my CV is distributed in PDF. I find that best as that
stops agencies from editing it. This causes massive confusion
to agents and on occasion they've even resorted to either a)
copying the text and pasting it into Word or b) retypoing it
from scratch.

I did the Agency Rating System <http://www.ars.org.uk/> some
years ago but I got bored and didn't put enough effort into marketing
it[1].

If anyone missed the stonehenge show - Randal has got it up on his website 
already and no doubt he'll put up the rest when he gets round to it - if his 
camera worked.

Theres a pretty cool one of him with stonehenge in the background.

<Lurk off>

There's a byacc that creates perl parsers, it's not the standard byacc and
it is hard to track down. I've put a copy on my web site,
http://www.mose.org.uk/Perl-byacc.tar.gz

Just a note, it's quite elderly and has no knowledge of perl objects, like
the YACC of yore it expects yyerror, yylex etc but apart from that it does
the job.

<Lurk on>

I attach my CV as plain text. Had an agent claim he couldn't read it
because it might contain a virus.

I'm sort of tempted to do something like:

This CV copyright 1994-2001 Piers Cawley <pdcawley@iterative-software.com>
You are licensed to pass verbatim copies of this CV to prospective clients.
You are not licensed to make any alterations, nor to convert it to any
other format.

at the bottom of mine. But with the market like it is, I don't want to
come across as stroppy.

Ditto. My other weekdays are at least single booked. (Wed. is only half-booked)

Ronald, that was very impressive! Using your trick
and ideas from Jas' delightful Acme::Smirch CPAN
module, I have come up with two program generators:

ob2.pl (Program generator based on Ronald's trick)
--------------------------------------------------
my %C;my $q;
# Default values.
$C{+chr} = "'" . chr() . "'" for 32..126;
# Sorry, can't handle these punctuation symbols.
$C{$_}="' '" for ('"',"'",'$','@','\\');
$C{"\n"} = q^'\\\\'.('`'|'.')^;
$C{'p'}  = q#(']'^'-')#;
# 'a' to 'o'
$C{chr($_+64)}=q^('`'|^.($q=$_==39?'"':"'").chr()."$q)" for 33..47;
# 'q'..'z'
$C{chr($_+80)}=q#((']'^'-')|#.($q=$_==39?'"':"'").chr()."$q)"
   for 33..42;
# 'A'..'Z'.
$C{+uc}=qq^($C{$_}&~\' ')^ for 'a'..'z';
print q^''=~('(?{'.^;
print qq^$C{p}.$C{r}.$C{i}.$C{n}.$C{t}.'"'^;
print map{'.'.$C{$_}}map/./gs,<>;
print q^.'"'.'})')^;

ob3.pl (uses older `$_` trick to write to stderr)
-------------------------------------------------
my %C;my $q;
# Default values.
$C{+chr} = "'" . chr() . "'" for 32..126;
# Sorry, can't handle these punctuation symbols.
$C{$_}="' '" for ('"',"'",'`','&','<','>','|','^','$','@','\\');
$C{' '}  = q^$"^;
$C{"\n"} = q^'\\\\'.($;|'.')^;
$C{'p'}  = '$:';
# 'a' to 'o'
$C{chr($_+64)}='($;|'.($q=$_==39?'"':"'").chr()."$q)" for 33..47;
# 'q'..'z'
$C{chr($_+80)}='($:|'.($q=$_==39?'"':"'").chr()."$q)" for 33..42;
# 'A'..'Z'.
$C{+uc}=qq^($C{$_}&~\$")^ for 'a'..'z';
my $e = q^$".'-'.($;|'%').'"'^;
print q^$#='#';$;='`';$:=$;|$%;$_=^;
print qq^$C{p}.$C{e}.$C{r}.$C{l}.$e.$C{w}.$C{a}.$C{r}.$C{n}.'\\"'^;
print map{'.'.$C{$_}}map/./gs,<>;
print q^.'\\""';`$_`^;

Example usage:
  perl ob2.pl fred.txt >fred.pl
where fred.txt contains, say:
  Just another Perl hacker
will generate a Perl program, fred.pl, containing
no alphnumeric characters. fred.pl can be manually
shaped into various animals or other things.

That is actually rather cool.

Note that

   '}_).} "*}_} }./}(}_ }}_, (}_+}_,*"'   &
 ~ '/-  +   *,+ <  + :- /:-   << :-  @'   |
   '  ``   @     `` `   @  ` `  `   '

evaluates to

  print "Just another Perl hacker,
  "

by bitwise string operations.

And (?{expr}) in a regexp is a zero-width assertion that evaluates the code
(and always succeeds).

Does that help?

This is what I thought.

So I now gathered. :-)

There has been another version of the post.

Wow! I tried to get it, and missed it when I posted it.

It helps me, I don't know if it helps everyone else. :-) Although I've also
just seen a very similar explanation. It takes a *very* sick mind to come
up with that, though...

But not me ;-)

Seriously, Friday is probably my least booked up day of the week, but to
be diplomatic we shall probably just alternate between the two in some
kind of disorganised fashion.  Or, as with london.pm, the Wednesday
heretics could make a bid for supremacy.

What's the protocol on this list regarding the posting of support 
questions?

My system is in a complete mess after upgrading to Mandrake 8.0 and KDE 
2.2 but I don't want to ask for help here unless it's OK to do so.

Cheers,

It seems to be a fairly even split at the moment between Wednesday and
Friday, with maybe a slight edge for the Wednesday's (but I would say
that!)

We could alternate, I suppose, but that's just going to cause confusion.

Set up an online ballot thingy with a non-anonymous vote, and the person
with the best automatic pseudonym generator voting script (presumably one fed
with the electoral roll for Cambridge) chooses the date?
You could even enforce that only subscribed e-mail addresses can vote,
and then only once. If so, better beef up the subscribe handler on the list :-)

usual sort of election]

Either that or set it to only work for current subscriptions, ie dump the
registration database and only use that.

The denizens of the as-yet-unnamed structure currently residing at
11 Atherton Close, Cambridge invite you to aid us in our quest to alter
the ambient temperature of said structure (we would suggest house-warming,
but it's still summer and we'd prefer it if you cooled it instead)
on Saturday 1st September 2001 at party o'clock.

Directions for the directionally-challenged: starting from Mitcham's
Corner, proceed in a leisurely fashion northwards along Milton Road, and
turn left down Ascham Road (the 3rd left if you count the Westbrook Centre
and the 2nd left if you don't). There's a library on the corner for ease of
identification and emergency book supplies. Turn right into Atherton Close
then left onto the large gravelly bit and we're in the far right corner. If
you get lost, phone us (01223 356412) so we can share in your bewilderment
(and possibly provide additional directions).

PBAB, PBAF, PB interesting things to eat, PB offerings to the god of
bookcases.  Featuring the party attic.  Limited parking/crash space
available.

Ah, was it you I nearly bumped into on the top of the stairs last night
as I was going to bed then?  Wasn't awake enough to introduce myself to
people at that time.  Hi :-)

Hello again Perlmongers.

I was wondering about modules. I don't have root on a certain machine (the
very machine this list is running on, so be glad I don't have root!) and I'd
like to install a module. More than that (which would probably just mean me
asking mbm), I want to repeatedly install, remove, and bugger about with it
to my own perverse ends.

I've come across lots of ways to do this and although many of them work, I
don't really understand the funky autoloader stuff and my brain is full at
the moment. I've tried blib, but I get the impression it's not what it's
designed for and although it works, it's rude to me on stderr which is bad
for my self-esteem. At the moment I just put blib/lib and blib/arch trees in
my homespace and added both of them to PERL5LIB.

Any suggestions of better things to do? I can't find in the man pages any
destructions on how to install modules as a non-root (branch?) user.

I'll perhaps see some of you at the House!warming Tomorrow?

Dan.

Hi LNR. Hope we didn't keep you guys awake.

On topic - I received a brochure for the Perl Whirl today (geekcruises.com).
Very tempting.

Oooh, yes.  Organisation.  Well seeing as Sue's in town, Wednesday seems
like a good day to start a 4-day drinking binge (I have a social life!).
Unless CAMRA/CURAS/you lot come up with any better suggestions, I'll say see
you in the Castle from about 7ish.  Feel free to bring along your own perl
guru.

The Sinister Greenend Organisation cordially invites you to celebrate
with us the passage of the first 10^9 non-leap seconds since the
start of the calendar.

At 02:46:40 +0100 (BST) on the 9th of September 2001 by the baroque
and obsolescent Christian calendar, the time_t will reach 1000000000,
or 0x3b9aca00, indicating T=1Gs since the beginning of our reckoning.

Please do join us, with your associates, at 155 Gilbert Road,
Cambridge.  We expect to consume intoxicating liquids, and we
recommend you bring some with you.  We suggest you arrive at
approximately T-23ks; celebrations are likely to continue until
perhaps T+4ks.

Ian.

Your punishment for being quiet is another rambling mail from me.  Even
London.pm's been quiet recently.

* Don't forget we have a nice relaxing social meet planned for tomorrow
evening in the Castle.  We have the lovely Sue visiting and I might even
buy a round.

* I've just added us to O'Reilly's user group list so we might get some
freebies soon ;-)

* Anyone been doing owt geekily exciting recently?  I've foolishly been
implementing hypergeometric probability distributions and considering
going to O'Reilly's bioinformatics conference in January.

* The House!warming party went with a bang and there should be
photographic evidence online soon.

Are you aware of GSL ( http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/ ) and the Perl
interface to it ( http://www.leto.net/code/gsl/ )?

I'm happily using GSL for my work, but in native C form, rather than
through Perl.

Excellent! I can find out what I got up to.

As for anything exciting and geeky, I've only been writing a wrapper around
Pg:: to do boring database stuff. "INSERT INTO sentence (purpose) VALUES ($_);";

:) Being passed out that's good. Can't do any harm then.

Pg is a DBI DBD but with different function names really. I know that seems
evil bad and wrong but Pg is supported by Postgresql, installed, and allows
me to use cunning Postgres specific features not in the DBI interface as far
as I know (like directly tinkering with your backend!). The whole thing is
Postgres specific enough that porting over to DBI wouldn't gain much, except
I'd have to learn use a new interface well.

The bit I'm writing is a wrapper so that, for a paritcular database it's
being written for, people can do 

$dbase->xsuby($x,$y);

to the module, and the module can say

INSERT INTO subkind SELECT b.super,a.sub,FALSE AS direct FROM ( SELECT sub
FROM subkind WHERE super=$x UNION SELECT $x AS sub) AS a, ( SELECT super
FROM subkind WHERE sub=$y UNION SELECT $y AS super )AS b EXCEPT SELECT
super,sub,FALSE AS direct WHERE super=$y AND sub=$x;

to Pg (DBI, whatever). And also so that the slow migration to server-side
functions can be hidden from everyone else (not all of the examples are as
computationally clean as that, a perl PL has been ruled out, and the database
has a tight deadline for deployment).

I've realised I'm not really very good at either Perl or SQL, tbh, I think
I'm destined for middle management, if I'm lucky, a sideshow at the the fair
if not! :) Still, getting a job would be cool, there's only so much fun to
be had from SQL in your spare time. :)

Mind you, the cvs man page isn't a model of conciseness. :)

Well, we had a pub meet last night; not as well attended as that last
one -- no Randal, but where were you all anyway? :-)

Brief summary:

We turned up in the Castle, we drank beer (and related substances), we
went to House!, people spodded until Tony stopped people spodding by
pulling the ADSL line out of the wall, people went to home/bed (I
presume).

Notable moments:

"I got run over by a car, but didn't even ladder my tights"
                                                   (Eleanor Blair)

"I like dipping into the onion" (Tony Finch)

Tony making a comment about MBM which caused Sue to attempt the nasal
insertion of her Guinness.

Tabloid newspaper headlines: see
                      http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/misc/campm.html

The summoning of various people by the mentioning of their name
                                   (Martin Cooper and Ian Jackson)

Ian's three `R's: routing, routing, and something I've forgotten. It was
funny at the time, OK?

Sue attempting the nasal insertion of her coffee at House!

That's it for now -- I'm off to coffee...

Including those people who voted for Wednesday.  *checks secret archive*
I hereby announce the next meet to be Friday 5th October, which should
give non-Cam people a chance to comce and crash and hang around for any
weekend parties.

I like my tabloids!

Routing, routing and reading.  If anyone doesn't get the joke (I didn't
the first time), 'ooting' is apparently Aussie for having sex.


> Sue attempting the nasal insertion of her coffee at House!

Could be worse.  Could be sherbert.


A poll.  In January which one should I go to?
* the Perl Whirl geekcruise, round the Caribbean - www.geekcruises.com
* the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Hawaii - psb.stanford.edu
* O'Reilly's bioinformatics conference, Arizona - conferences.oreilly.com

And Stephen, what kind of probabilist are you?  I may need your help.

Hmmm... from the message headers:

would appear to accomplish the same function :-)

in anticipation of Nicks very rude email - I will respond

Ausralians tend to be careful of others feelings in general

We try not to call cellotape/stickytape Durex while in UK
We attempt to remember that Thongs are not things on peoples feet
We dont make references to XXXX in Japan where XXXX is a brand of condom
and we expect you to not refer to network devices using words that mean "to fuck"

I think this is a reasomable expectation.

Hmm, it sounds to me more like Austrailians being very careful not to
give other people opportunities to take the piss.

Yep, it does.

Well that's just 'cause there aren't enough of you lot around to get
any joke you might make about it.

Actually, IME routers are rather good at fucking the network.

Whaddya mean? Aussies get all over the place. They positively overrun some
bits of London.

> Actually, IME routers are rather good at fucking the network.

Especially if your "network" consists of a DHCP server, running on a laptop,
(which is, obviously, asleep half the time) which gives the network default
router (another laptop, obviously) a lease. 

ie. FSVO "network". :-)

Laptops are small, quiet and don't need a UPS. They also tend not to have
ventilation slots in the top, so you can stand coffee on them.

Those of you who have seen my T-shirt will be happy to know that since
returning home on Tuesday I have already fixed two computers.

Subject: Simon Cozens is the Source Pumpking

I'm happy to say that, in preparation for the release of the first
piece of Parrot code, Simon Cozens has stepped forward to hold the
source pumpkin.

Simon's responsible for the contents of the internal and external
source distribution.  He'll update the CVS repository with patches
submitted by the public to perl6-internals.  He'll make periodic
releases available on CPAN.  He'll also build an initial team of
committers from those who submit good patches.

Simon will have to work closely with many people, including:
 * Larry, who is designing the language
 * Dan, who is designing the internals
 * Schwern and everyone else from QA, who will be responsible for
   smoking the builds, unit testing, and more
 * The as-yet-unknown configuration and build group, responsible
   for determining system configuration and the build process.

Hi all...

As people may be aware, the first release of Parrot (the bytecode
interpreter which will be used as the backend for Perl 6) was released
yesterday - see
http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-announce%40perl.org/msg00293.html
for details.

Has anyone else tried this yet? I can some results from test.pasm, but
test2.pasm and test3.pasm both coredump on me:

cass30:pak:~/data2/parrot$ perl assemble.pl t/test2.pasm > test2.pbc 
cass30:pak:~/data2/parrot$ ./test_prog test2.pbc 
Bus Error (core dumped)

this on:

cass30:pak:~/data2/parrot$ uname -a
SunOS cass30 5.8 Generic_108528-10 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4

Is this just me and my system?

Phil

I'd suggest asking on perl6-internals@perl.org

Without having actually looked at the parrot code my 2 stock answers would be

1: I think that they were talking about it always threading.
   IIRC bus errors on Solaris can be due to bugs in Sun's threading libraries

or

2: You may well be the first person to compile on an architecture that
   objects to non-word-aligned access. (Dan has VMS alpha, Simon I think
   has x86 Linux). In which case your build experience would be useful.
   (I really must compile my arm linux kernel to SIGBUS a process on
    misaligned reads/writes. And then hassle 'till the bugs are fixed)

That'd be (2), then. The padding for string constants was being doing as
length % sizeof(IV), rather than sizeof(IV) - (length % sizeof(IV). Now
fixed in the Parrot CVS (although not by me).

test3.pbc is still segfaulting, though...

<fx: looks around. Where's everybody gone?>

Does anyone know if there are any artifical limits on how deep Perl
subroutines can recurse? (Some of my simulations may be of the same
order of magnitude as 2^16 in the near future, and I don't want them to
blow up after 12 hours of runtime :-) )

Cheers,

  I don't know if there are any limits, but I'm intrigued as to what problem
might be sensibly addressed with 2^16 levels of recursion.  Don't leave us
hanging like that.

Perl will certainly warn, and possibly blow up after 100 levels of
stack with the same function. Doing O(2^16) sounds incredibly worrying,
and possibly better solved in some other way than recursion, as you'll
need a stack frame for each level. Can you do it with tail-recursion
instead, using intermediate variables rather than stack frames, perhaps
by doing it in Scheme or Lisp?

I just tried it with:

#! /usr/bin/perl -w

sub recurse ($)
{
    print "$_[0] ";
    recurse ($_[0] + 1);
}

recurse 0;

It seems only to warn ("Deep recursion on subroutine "main::recurse" at
./recurse.pl line 6."). At >200000 levels of recursion, though, it was
taking up ~80Mb of memory just with stack frames.

I'd agree with that. You can unfold any recursion into iteration
(trivially, using your own stack, or perhaps in some cleverer way).
Recursive code is often very elegant and easy to understand, but at that
kind of depth it's unlikely to be efficient unless the language is built
for it.

Since Perl didn't optimize away the tail-recursion in my code above, I'd
guess that it's not the best language to use for deeply recursive code.

Warn. Unless you have

| no warnings 'recursion'

at the top of your code :-)

> Doing O(2^16) sounds incredibly worrying, and possibly better solved
> in some other way than recursion

Definitely (and in fact, trivially) solved without recursion, but I
started thinking about this and got interested...

FWIW, I've got a function which is zero across most of its domain, but
has a few irregularly shaped (but relatively large) areas in which its
value is non-zero. What I'd basically like is the average value of the
function across its entire domain; hence I want to sample the bits in
which it is non-zero. The previous ugly algorithm was:

* Look at point (x,y) and store its value.
* If non-zero, recurse to all of
    (x-1,y+1), (x,y+1), (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y  ),          (x+1,y  ), 
    (x-1,y-1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y+1)
  unless they've already been done.

Trivial fix (in fact, what I've already done) is to just use a
{list,stack} to store the points I'm going to need to look at, but I was
just wondering...

Ah, connected region analysis?

If running time is important, or the image is very large, /you don't want to
do it like that/ really.

If the image is being read in incrementally and is then thrown away because
it's too big, then the best thing to do is to create sticks of contiguous
set pixels on each row, and then merge them into stick lists based on which
sticks they're underneath, IYSWIM. One advantage with this representation is
that whilst at the end you usually want to convert it into a pixmap, for
some large strucutres with big holes in (like black borders around a page)
the stick representation is actually smaller.

If you want a cool fast algorithm, and the image at 32-bits would happily
sit in core, then there's one that I worked on with RRW. What you do is
first create this image (called the map) of the same size, 32-bits deep and
blank. You also create an equivalence class. That's a thing which records
what's equivalent to what. It's a data structure that receives assertions
like "3 is equivalent to 6" and "6 is equivalent to 12" and can answer
questions like "is 3 equivalent to 12?". Anyway, you zoom through the
original image and look only at the pixel above and the pixel to the left,
and only then if your pixel is set. If the up pixel is set but not the left,
or the left but not the up, then set the equivalent position in the map to
the same value as the value in the map for the pixel that's set. If both up
and left are set and they've the same value in the map, then do the same. If
they're both set and have a different map value, set the value in the map to
one of them and assert into your equivalence class that they're equivalent.
If neither up or left are set, create a previously unused value for the map
and set it to that When you've done that for each class of equivalent
numbers choose a representive number (any of them). Then do a second pass
across the map, and this time recolour everything to the colour of the
representitive.

What you've got then is a map where each region is a different colour. It
kicks ass because though it's two pass it's got monster cache locality and a
simple inner loop.

One way to implement equivalence classes is with trees with only parent
links (or the array equivalent). You have something called the canon which
is the root of each tree (which you can use as your representitive in the
second pass). When two things are asserted to be equivalent, you zoom down
the tree of each of them to see what their canons are. If they're the same
you do nothing, if different make the canon of one point to the other
(making a bigger tree). When you find a canon from a number at some
distance, it sometimes helps to move the link to point to the canon itself
for speed.

eg, 1=2, 1=3, 4=3, 5=6

     1    5
    / \   |
   2   3  6
       |
       4

6=4
                                1
    1                         / | \
   /|\                      / / | \ \
  2 3 5 can be optimised to 2 3 5 4 6 if you want
    | |
    4 6

I'd recommend C, though.

Of course, this problem might not be connected region analysis. But I like
my rants. :)

Simon was saying that he could come to the pub and give us a talk on the
Parrot Virtual Machine (or Parrot Virtual Computer, as was suggested at
last night's london.pm technical meeting) if the meet is on a friday. Would
people be interested in having him come and show us parrot (at the latest
stage)?

Yes please. I've not been following that as closely as I should have
been.

Didn't someone mention October 5th? (first Friday of term. Do I go and
associate with all the other people just starting in my department, or do
I go and spend time with people who aren't going to want to talk about
their exciting experimental work? Hmm...)

I'm sorely tempted to reimplement this large pile of C++ I have to deal
with in Perl. My life would suddenly become a lot easier.

Oh, you went to the tech meet?  Simon would be v. welcome, as would

Unless you have a compiler (or language) that explicitly advertises
tail recursion optimization as a feature, don't expect to get it.
In particular, gcc doesn't do it. (ncc on the Arm does, though)

erm. I suppose I should say something on topic.
perl -e 'no tailrecursion' or something.

Quicksort on a large almost-sorted array. Whoops, that's more like
"accidentally" rather than "sensibly".

Actually gcc 3 can do tail call optimization (not just for recursion,
either; notice the "jmp printf" at the end).

That's interesting. Is it just a peephole optimisation for call/ret pairs,
or part of an eventual grand scheme of tail recursion. I'm interested for
the sake of these compile-to-GCC-source non-imperitive languages.

Looking at calls.c:expand_call() (a mere 1400 lines, though that's
with the insane GNU indent style), it would appear to be the latter.

Possibly.  Alternatively we could have it on the 12th and rollover

I'd probably prefer the weekend of the 5th, but could rearrange things for
the 12th...

It probably makes it easier to fit into my hectic (cough) social life...

I'm vaguely curious as to how much effort and money it's worth putting 
into something in order to slightly reduce my overall workload. I suppose 
that I could just outsource my entire PhD to someone in India and devote 
my time to appearing in NTK more often.

On topic, though - I've never used Perl for any terribly serious
scientific apps, so have absolutely no idea how useful it is for
performing reasonably computationally heavy tasks. The program in question
is effectively picking random numbers, doing lookups in a table based on 
those and then picking another random number to see whether what it's got 
out of the table actually happens or not. If it does, it does weird shit 
(tm) to an array and then goes back to step 1. The configuration file 
parsing currently seems to be a nightmare and would probably be reason 
enough to reimplement things from scratch, but it already takes upwards of 
12 hours for some runs and I don't really want to find that becoming 
significantly larger. Is this sort of thing feasible?

bunkum. You decreed it to be on the 5th; a pre-emptive strike intended to
stop anyone suggesting a Wednesday :-)

Is it a good idea to have cam.pm meetings on days close to London.pm meetings,
considering the overlap between inmates^Wmembers?
(But please don't choose a date just to suit me, as then I'll look silly if
I don't turn up)

One possibility is of course to leave the nasty CPU intensive stuff in
some other language and then call it from a scriptable language like
perl.  Whether you do this as something like a swig of XS perl module,
or embed some other interpreter such as tcl in your C/C++ program is
more or less up to you.

Although I haven't written any code this way ye, I use a number of
scientific apps that do work this way, and they're a joy to automate as
a result - e.g tcl scripts driving automated DNA sequence assembly with
the Staden package.

It's quite a bit more painful to do this sort of thing with
non-scriptable alternatives like phrap, which is a shame because it's a
better assembly engine.

This is the flan.  Tempt more people (including Nodnol overlap) to come by
having social on Friday and party on Saturday.  Hence moving to the 12/13th.

I think I prefer the 12th too, as it gives me time to finish the new look

  I've found it usably fast for handling and processing large volumes of

As long as you have the RAM to support it.  Its memory use is massively
inefficient compared to something you can roll yourself in C.  AIUI,
this should improve in perl 6 when you can explicitly state certain
arrays will contain certain data types, allowing the compiler to use
more efficient code.

Has anyone here tried anything like this using Inline? (I've not.)
It's rumoured to make the job embedding as easy as writing a perl subroutine.

That's a dangerous thing to say ;-)  Unfortunately, I'm no expert which is why
I'm going to make the following CFB[0].  I would muchly appreciate any nice geek
assistance with a hardware upgrade (i.e. more memory!) and (probably) Debian
installation on hades[1].  Might also do minion as well.

Back to reinstalling perl.  Grrr.

I perform system administration and general hardware kicking for cash,
food or alcohol (or most combinations thereof). I also have a wide range 
of exciting T-shirts to wear while doing so and am highly versed in the 
necessary incantations[1] to cause magic to occur.

I'm sure you can manage the RAM upgrade on your own - it's just a matter
of taking the cover off and shoving it in the appropriate slot.  Oooh,
matron.

The debian installation is a little trickier, although if you've
installed another Linux distro before, you'll at least have some
understanding of the questions it asks you!

I tend to prefer using any lusers who are present at the time. I've found 
this technique to be almost as effective while at the same time reducing 
the amount I have to carry and reducing the probability of the rubber 
chicken ethical treatment league setting fire to my house. It's also 
significantly more satisfying.

I run a dual boot win98/Linux Mandrake system (8.0) which is mostly 
stable now after a few hiccups (mostly my fault).  Linux is much better 
for programming, Windows is much better for games (which is why I run a 
dual boot - I like games, a child at heart).

What do you want to know?  If you want to borrow Mandrake CD's or get 
help setting up a system then let me know.  My price is usually in pints 
of beer though ;-)

Beware of cross-posting.

Just to give you advance warning that Cam.pm's next social will be Friday
12th October, from about 7pm in the Castle Inn, Castle Street, Cambridge
(map on website).  I'll investigate reserving the big table upstairs and
send reminders nearer the time.  And someone remind me to send this to
cam.misc.

To give the Nodnolers even more of an excuse for coming to visit,
House! is also planning a party on Saturday 13th.  Just checking the guest
of honour will be available.

How terrible and how serious?  Some of my gene hacking apps[0] are bodged
together in not-wonderful perl and run for about 18 hours, in which
case I just leave them overnight.  This approach is the path of least
hassle at the moment, as I've got far too many thigns to do.  I think
we've already mentioned Inline.pm.  Shall report back when I get it
working.

Anyone else spotted this one? :-)
I wasn't thinking of applying for it, because it's out of Radio 4 transmission
range. [Internet Radio 4 no good, as the BBC doesn't have the rights to
transmit every program online, so there can be gaps]

why many people are jobhunting?
Because many people are losing their jobs, because it seems companies are
going down on people.
I don't know of any jobs, and sometime in the next 0-6 weeks I'll be looking
again when this one ends.

Eep!  Shall add you to the list.  Hmm, don't you (generic) think it would
be useful if someone did  a UK/Europe only version of the jobs-perl mailing
list?

Funky lift.  Reminds me of 'Only Forward' by Michael Marshall Smith.

For anyone who hasn't caught it as yet, Apocalypse 3 (the third in Larry
Wall's series of articles about what Perl 6 is going to be like) is now
available:

http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/10/02/apocalypse3.html

I haven't really read it yet, though.

It's a rather interesting read, especially all the stuff about
hyperoperators. (^=~ - watch out for that flying operator ...) And //,
thank you God for a sensible way of abbreviating that.

Lazy lists look like they're going to be the most intriguing change. I
came out of the Apocalypse with the impression that Larry wasn't quite
sure how they were going to work or look yet, though.

I'm probably suffering from brain failure, here, but I'm looking for an
elegant way to do turn something like:

$before = { foo => [ $a, $b, $c ], bar => [ $d, $e, $f ], ... }

into

[ $a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f ... ]

The size of each array reference may vary.  Obviously, I can do
something like:

$after = [];

foreach (values %$before) {
    push @$after, @$_;
}

But I was wondering if there was a more elegant way that doesn't involve
so much data movement (I suspect the above could get very slow if
$before is a large data structure).

Any ideas?

Tim.

I don't know of any way to avoid data movement for an operation like
that, unless you are willing to add a layer of indirection. I don't
know whether or not perl optimises foreach (values) or foreach (keys).

On Thursday 04 October 2001 16:22 pm, the mighty poet Tim Cutts said on 
the wire:
"" [cut]
"" But I was wondering if there was a more elegant way that doesn't
 involve "" so much data movement (I suspect the above could get very
 slow if "" $before is a large data structure).
""
"" Any ideas?
""

For a very large data structure, each() is a better bet than values(), 
as it doesn't have to create the entire list:

while( my $ref = ( each %{$before} )[-1] ) {
	push @{$after}, @{$ref};
}

You still have the overhead of the de-reference, which may be 
significant if the hash value is large.  It's still not what anyone 
might describe as 'elegant', though.

Cheers,

Steve

Isn't that more a memory issue than a speed issue? I interpreted Tim's
problem as being a speed one -- he was trying to avoid copying every
array element of every value of %$before.

Well, it becomes a speed issue as well.  Certainly with large data
structures (such as wot I have here!)

while (($key, undef) = each %$hash) {
    ...
}

is *much* faster than

foreach (keys %$hash) {
    ...
}

I only ever use keys these days for one of the following reasons:
1)  Order is important (i.e. I need "sort keys")
2)  The size of the hash is known to be very small
3)  I actually need the full array for some reason

'values' I use rather more often for creating non-redundant lists via a
hash.

It may be slow, but something like:

$foo->set_nr_list([ values %nr_hash ]);

is a lot more readable for other people than:

my $arr = [];
while ((undef, $value) = each %nr_hash) {
    push @$arr, $value;
}
$foo->set_nr_list($arr);

It may even be faster, although I suspect the [ values ] involves
copying the entire array into the new anonymous array reference.

[ tries a bit of benchmarking ]

Hmm.  Now I'm surprised.  I tried taking a reference to what values
returned, rather than enclosing it in [], and it's actually *slower*:

use Benchmark;

%foo = ();

for (1..100000) {
    $foo->{"key$_"} = "value$_";
}

timethese (1000000, {
    'AnonRef' => '$a = [ values %foo ]',
    'Context' => '$a = \@{values %foo}'
});

11:28:42 timc@bio1:ticut$ perl test.pl
Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of AnonRef, Context...
   AnonRef:  9 wallclock secs ( 8.98 usr +  0.00 sys =  8.98 CPU)
   Context: 12 wallclock secs (10.33 usr +  0.01 sys = 10.34 CPU)

Curious.  Perhaps the [ values ] is actually optimised, so that values
puts its stuff straight into the new array reference.

Tim.

Obviously, I don't know how large `large' is, but on one of our Sparcs
here:

use Benchmark;

$foo = {};

for (1..100000) {
  $foo->{$_} = $_;
}

timethese( 50,
           { keys => 'foreach( keys %$foo ) { $foo->{$_}=$_ }',
             each => 'while( ($key,undef) = each %$foo ) { $foo->{$key}=$_ }'
           } );

I get:

Benchmark: timing 50 iterations of each, keys...
each: 68 wallclock secs (67.90 usr +  0.00 sys = 67.90 CPU) @ 0.74/s (n=50)
keys: 35 wallclock secs (34.76 usr +  0.01 sys = 34.77 CPU) @ 1.44/s (n=50)

Am I missing something here?

Phil

Why would you ever do the latter? They are both copying every value,
but with values the copying loop is compiled whereas with each it
is interpreted.

On Friday 05 October 2001 10:36 am, the mighty poet Philip Kendall said 
on the wire:

Hmm, you may have a point.

However, if the 'before' and 'after' data structures can't be changed, 
then I can't,  off the top of my head , think of an obvious way round 
this.

If they *can*, I'd be inclined to try 'stringifying' the data in the 
array ref, or encode it with pack(), c.f. Guttman-Rosler 
Transformation.  On the ouput side, this lets you use some combination 
of join, split and/or substr ( or unpack ).  My gut instinct is that 
this would by quicker than the array-copying solution we currently 
have.  If I get a minute, I'll do some benchmarking.

OTOH, I'm inclined to quote Abigail on clpm: 'If speed is important, 
why are are you using Perl?'

Cheers,

Steve

Hmm.  Looks like the received wisdom may be wrong.  I suppose the each
version uses less memory, so it reduces swapping, which could make it
faster on a loaded machine.  Some of my sccripts run on machines which
are almost permanently swapping, to some extent.  Switching my scripts
from foreach (keys ...) to while (each) made a significant improvement
in RAM use and wall clock run time.

Interestingly, the difference is much smaller if you change foo
from a hash reference to a hash:

use Benchmark;

%foo = ();

for (1..100000) {
  $foo{$_} = $_;
}

timethese( 50,
           { keys => 'foreach( keys %foo ) { $foo{$_}=$_ }',
             each => 'while( ($key,undef) = each %foo ) { $foo{$key}=$_
}'
           } );

Preumably, the repeated calls to each %$foo are painful due to the
dereference required each time.

The problem with that approach is that it makes code maintenance
significantly more of an issue.  You can't trivially examine data in the
perl debugger any more.

Speed is not the paramount consideration.  However, that doesn't mean
that it isn't a consideration at all...

As it happens, quite a lot of this perl code is to take data out of
various database sources (ACeDB, Sybase), munge it in various ways,
munge it with external programs in various other ways, and put the
results back into ACeDB/Sybase.  Quite a lot of this code will soon be
replaced with Java procedures within the Sybase server itself.

I've booked one of the large tables upstairs.  Though $woman said to try
and get there early.  Funny how the Catle was deadly quiet the week before
Randal's visit when a few of us went on  atest run, and has been packed
ever since.

Numbers...shurg. Several definites.  We're probably have an Eddie Izzard
video viewing at House afterwards.

  http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/dorkbot/dorkbotlondon/

a new monthly forum for people to show off their works, and chatter.
it's twinned with the year-old dorkbotnyc, which has so far featured
robots, gameboy music, live video processing, talking popcorn, 360
degree virtual theatre, sound sculpture, giant throbbing pillows and
experiments in plant cruelty, and other strange things.  what dorks.

let us know if you'd like to give a 5 or 20 minute talk about
something.

it's still in a planning stage, but we already have a date (nov 7th),
time (7pm GMT) and excellent venue (the boxing club).  please pass the
word on to anyone you think might be interested.

hope to see you there,

shopping spree. No purchase necessary. Enter the drawing at:

release: http://press.oreilly.com/safari_jvlaunch.html

According to SeyboldReports.com, Safari Books Online is Inexpensive,
easy to use, and loaded with high-quality content--the Safari online
reference service for IT professionals will provide stiff competition
for Books24x7.com.

I'll stick the photos (that I'm not ashamed of) on a website somewhere

Lots of gratuitous Eddie Izzard references.  Colin's unoriginal "get
out of the gutter, you're blocking my periscope" came up at the House!
party.  Someone berating the lack of Perl personalities, not realising
they were sat next to The Boy Cozens.

Woo.  Karma to Nodnolers who came to invade.[0]

Not enough sex and too much violence.

[0] For bonus points:  Nodnol, as portrayed in the Red Dwarf epiosde
'Backwards', was actually Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester.[1]

brain melts.

 I remember "The sea is on fire and in danger of collapsing", and a comment
in the discussion of ablative shields [ for the Space Shuttle and the like ]
suggesting that they should be met with vocative missiles which I think was
Simon Cozens, both from the Houise! party.  Nice house, nice party, and next
time I'll put a big Parental Advisory label on the chocolate coffee beans.

Don't see why.  I think I ate a good quarter or so of the packet and
slept fine that night, despite getting to bed as early as 1 am.  It was
last night I couldn't sleep, and I hadn't even had any coffee.

I think caffeine jsut has this weird failure to affect me much.

Subject: Invading Cambridge


Mission date: 12/10/2001

A crack team of London perl mongers [1] ventured far outside of their
normal environs to invade the home of cam.pm.

Their assembly was successfully assaulted, despite being holed up in a
very defensible position at the very top of the pub, and much decent beer
was quaffed [2]. A smaller group than we would expect at a london.pm meet
but all fine people and most welcoming of the invasion force. A neutral
observer, in the form of Simon Cozens (lathos), was also welcomed into the
group.

Following this we were billeted at the home of cam.pm's own fearless
leader Lucy (sphyg) where we were made most comfortable and fed with fine
food, tea and bandwidth.

Saturday's mission was a skirmish at Lucy's house, where we faced a
combined assault from crack teams of Cambridge goffs and geeks. Despite
losses in the afternoon (Leon heading home) and the evening (Sue going
AWOL to another party) we put in a creditable display of london.pm
drinking ability.

Sunday is best left to the imagination of the reader.

So a big thanks to cam.pm for the welcome and to Lucy in particular for

OK. I'm going to say this now: I'd rather not see this list turn into a
repeat of greg mccarroll and his constant use of london.pm for testing.
I'll even go as far as to set up a cam.pm.test@cam.pm.org if you like,
but please don't post it to *this* list.

Sorry.

This is one of my buttons.

Hi,
	A regular expression brain teaser for anyone is interested  (well,
it might not be a brain teaser to someone more expert than I)
	I have to parse a line of text which is a list of comma separated
values.  I started out using a simple split function

@foo = split /,/, $bar;

Then I discovered that some of the values were strings of text containing
commas.  They can be distinguished as single values by the fact that they
are delimited by double quotes e.g.

"This is a sentence, with a comma", <value>, <value>

I wondered if anyone could see a way to split this list using *one* regular
expression?  (i.e. continue using the split function)
Any ideas please cc directly to bruce.ashton@metoffice.com as I've only just
subscribed to this list, and I haven't received any sign on email or
anything.

If I can't find such a regular expression I may yet be forced to write a new
subroutine...

The correct way to do this is to 
use Text::CSV;

but:
/,?"((?:[^"]|"")*)",?|,/
although you'll probably need a grep {defined $_} in front of the split;

You'll also want a
shift @foo if $str=~ /^"/;
pop @foo if $str=~ /"$/;

so:

@foo=grep {defined $_} split /,?"((?:[^"]|"")*)",?|,/,$str;
shift@foo if $str=~/^"/;
pop@foo if $str=~/"$/;

should leave @foo with the correct answer.

Unfortunately, it's annoyingly difficult to deal with the other cases.

You should do soon, then.

I think this one is *almost* right. As I say, I can't get it to get rid of
the end cases properly.

Slightly better:
@foo=split /,"((?:[^"]|"")*)",|,/,",$str,"; shift @foo; pop @foo;

Golf, anyone?

Until you assign, there's no way to know how long the array is, so you can't
even do a range operator on it....

It is, of course, still better to use Text::CSV.

Why do you have to use split() ?   A multiple-match regular expression
handles this quite nicely:

    my (@a) = /(\"(?:\\.|[^\"])*\"|[^,\n]+),?/g;
    
If you want to strip out the surrounding quotes and any escaped internal
quotes, you can follow it up with:

    map  { s/^\"(.*)\"$/$1/; s/\\\"/\"/g; } @a;
    
See for example the following example program:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

while (<DATA>) {
    my (@a) = /(\"(?:\\.|[^\"])*\"|[^,\n]+),?/g;
    map  { s/^\"(.*)\"$/$1/; s/\\\"/\"/g; } @a;
    print join("\n", @a, '');
}

__DATA__
Wibble,12345,"Foo, Bar","\"The cat sat on the mat\", she said"

Which prints out:

Wibble
12345
Foo, Bar
"The cat sat on the mat", she said

I use something very similar to this to parse the output tables of ACeDB
AQL queries (although they are whitespace separated, not commas).

Tim.

Hmm.  just realised my solution doesn't handle empty fields properly.

<thinks>

Ah.  This seems to work:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

while (<DATA>) {
    my (@a) = /(\"(?:\\.|[^\"])*\"|[^,\n]*)[,\n]/g;
    map  { s/^\"(.*)\"$/$1/; s/\\\"/\"/g; } @a;
    print join("\n", @a, '');
}

__DATA__
Wibble,12345,,"Foo, Bar","\"The cat sat on the mat\", she said"

i.e. every non-quoted field *has* to be terminated either with a comma
or a new line.

Text::CSV?  Who needs it?  :-)

Apparently, you. :-) I believe that the correct CSV `"'-quoting is `""'.

(hence the regexp that I chose in my solution. :-)

Ah.  As I said, mine was derived from code to parse ACeDB output which
escapes quotes in the way that my code deals with.  I suspect other
program may also quote that way.

My point was rather:  why use split rather than the global pattern
match?  Is there an efficiency difference?

It occurs to me that my regexp should probably begin with \G as well,
since all matches in a CSV line should follow each other directly.

Tim.

I thought that one of the problems with CSV was that there is no spec.
Hence different incompatible ways of quoting (or not being able to quote)
were all equally valid. It's just that the more common way of doing it is
foo, not bar.

Still, is there good reason not to use Text::CSV?

Thanks for all the suggestions, some of them worked better than others.  I
came up with my own solution as well,

@foo = split /("[^"]*")?,$1/, $bar;

It works as well as any others that I tested, although it did have some
strange behaviour. if I passed $bar as an argument to a subroutine
containing the split call in my test, it behaved differently to when I split
in the string in the main body of the script.  This is when $bar was defined
as,

$bar = '"some text","some text, with comma",0';

I also noted that the reference to $1 did not depend on whether the first
bracketed expression matched, it was equivalent to cutting and pasting the
bracketed expression at the position of the reference.  Is that correct?
	This solution would also have been ideal if the expression in the
brackets wasn't pushed onto @foo at each split as well.  Is there anyway to
modify that behaviour?
	I didn't test all the other solutions completely.  I ended up just
using Text::CSV as suggested (A module I wasn't previously aware of.)  I
guess this was the answer I really wanted.

Surely "humans have lots of DNA in common with xyz is old news now...
Perhaps California is behind the times.

What, me?  Been catching up after sleeping in <- knocking myself
out with sleeping pills <- sore shoulder <- nipped nerve <- being cramped
in a corner of the office.

We'd love to have a tech meet if we can arrange, um, a venue and,
um, more speakers and, um, appropriate technical wizardry.  Um.  Any
ideas?

There seems to be an important piece of information missing from those
pages - what does "Grade" translate to in terms of salary/conditions/whatever
[I believe that there's some fun and games involved, as IIRC I was told
that EBI pays as an ex-patriate employer, so "gross" and "net" salaries are
pretty close]

Is it possible for people with a current affiliation to the University to be
able to book rooms for non-University groups? If so, we could always hold
tech meetings in, say, one of the lecture theatres.

The other question is, of course, cost, as we don't make any money. I don't
suppose that UoC would be particularly willing to fund cam.pm. Damn.

I don't know what the answer is. Also, who currently has a talk that they
want to give? I don't yet, though I've got one in the pipeline if I can get
the relevant module written (tuits, tuits, tuits).

I suspect this varies depending on the college/department involved; I
don't think I can at my college (Trinity Hall), but I've never actually
tried this at all...

I suspect there would at least be a commercial rent.

  Certainly when I was there, on the first two years of my PhD, the
explanation was that working for the EBI technically counts as being an EU
civil servant and therfore exempts you from income tax on what they pay you.

[renting rooms for tech meetings]

We've never had to. Various members' employers have been kind
enough to let us use their rooms for free in the evenings.

The one time we needed to hire a room was when Damian Conway
came to town in February. In that case we hired a room in the
Conway Hall and a number of members contributed towards the cost[1].

Dave...

[1] IIRC, four of them contributed ~50 each. Conway Hall isn't
exactly expensive :)

Very appropriately named ;-)  Darwin's only diddy, though I might be able
to book a room for non-college purposes.  It's a bit chilly for the
island ;-)

I can probably swing something at New Hall, perhaps lean on a current
student or other to book it for me.  The Long Room was quite swish when I
was there.

That would be useful.  I don't think the Darwin ent rooms are wired up
with things.  We could try and get The Boy Cozens over.

As much as I like having arguments, I'm fed up with this one.

There are reasons for and against. I've read them both, and when I set up
the list I decided to go for reply-to being set. Now, yes, it does cause
the occasional embarassing thing, and yes, it can be harmful, but I've
seen that happen in news too, and I've seen it happen in other media. If
you're used to "replying to list", then you may do that as a finger macro
and the effect is the same.

I'm not going to argue for and against here, and despite the fact that we
don't have an official topic per se, I'm going to declare this argument
OT.

Quite frankly, people need to use their emailers, news clients etc.
sensibly. This kind of thing reminds people that they need to think before
they post things, and god knows I've been on the wrong side of that enough
times.

</rant>

Anyway, to get back ON TOPIC, did we actually work out anything we wanted
to say in a tech meeting, let alone where one was going to be held?

One thing it does is confuse trn, which uses the reply-to adress for the
attribution line.  This is considered trn's fault though rather than
anything else. :-) Mostly I agree with Richard on this though.

The bit in the article which talks about it adding nothing however does
gloss over the fact that a reply-to-all or followup will go to the
author as well as to the list.  And the next message with go to you, the
author you responded to and the list.  And if people aren't pretty
disciplined you end up getting dozens of copies of messages to a list
twice, which is a nuisance.

The right answer is for people to be careful and to fix it.  Dougsoc
have an interesting wrong answer whereby the list software only sends
you a copy via the list if you're not already a recipient, even keeping
a list of other addresses you use for this purpose.  Setting reply-to
just to avoid this I can see is also a slightly wrong answer, due to the
problems the article outlines.

It should just admit that this slight problem exists though, rather than
pretending it doesn't.

This one completely ignores the fact that in most "reasonable" mailers
one can hit reply-to-all and then *delete the other addresses*.

More importantly despite being an obvious direct copy fo the style of
the other article, mostly addressing each point within it but form the
opposite point of view, it entirely fails to address the problem of an
author who has their *own* reply-to address.

I could set one here and you would never see it because it would get
munged, any replies made to me will end up in the wrong place.

This to me is the *one* big argument for not munging reply-to lines on
lists.

That's rather undermined by sections like this:

    Reply-To gives the respondant an option which would not otherwise
    exist: namely the ability to reply only to the list.

This is simply not true.  Every mailer I've ever used has allowed me
to edit headers and construct replies sent to exactly where I want
them - IOW, the ability exists even without the Reply-To field.

The proper solution is something like the Mail-Followup-To field.

Would one possibility be a cam.pm not-so tech meeting, where some of the
more recent converts to Perl can see how some of the older hands would
solve a problem?

Would there be any interest in this? (Come on all you lurkers, I know
you're out there :-) ).

How about non-recent converts who don't get enough practice at Perl?

(apologies for the messed-up quoting, it's GroupWise, need I say more?)

Must get back to lurking.

Would one possibility be a cam.pm not-so tech meeting, where some of the
more recent converts to Perl can see how some of the older hands would
solve a problem?

Would there be any interest in this? (Come on all you lurkers, I know
you're out there :-) ).

I have to say, I think that a Perl workshop could be a very good thing.
Perhaps some kind of classes on useful things you can do with regexps,
references, blessing and object-orientation and maybe even some kind of
workshop on, say, Perl/Tk or Perl/GTK that would be quite good if we knew
how to use it, but that most of us don't get a chance to, or even, mod_perl
or CGI.pm

There's potentially a lot of mileage in that.

Is there any interest in a November social meet?

If so, when? A Wednesday or a Friday? (or possibly, in a break with
non-very long established tradition, a different day?)

And who'd turn up?

Me, if it was on a Friday.

I vote for next Friday.

I also suggest that the lurkers should turn up too! :-)

  A Wednesday would be better for me.

  I would on a Wednesday; may not be able to on a Friday.  Whether you see
this as reason to vote for a Wednesday or a Friday is up to you.

There's no point being a lurker if you're going to turn up at a public =
event...

(on the other hand I suppose the proper way for lurkers to attend would be =
to sit at a nearby table and listen in, or hide behind a potted plant or =
something)

Me, if it was on a Friday.

I vote for next Friday.

I also suggest that the lurkers should turn up too! :-)

  The canonical way of doing this is to leave a post-it note saying
"lurking" on the mirror in the gents, so that all the overt attendees spend
the evening trying to spot you.

Ooh, I forgot it was now November.  Should've realised when I had to put
tights on this morning.

Next week I can only do Tuesday the 6th - conveniently both Colin's
birthday and a beerfest on at the USSC.  Otherwise it would have to be
the week after.  Or you could just do it without me.

I tried this one once at a MUD meet, sitting next to the group, who didn't
know what I looked like, and listening to what they were saying. By one of
those amazing coincidences, someone unconnected with the meet, whom I
hadn't seen in years, shouted from across the room, "Martin Keegan, WHAT
are you doing in this country?", and my cover was blown.

Not an official cam.pm thing, but I propose a trip to the beer festival at
the University Sports and Social Club on Mill Lane.  I'll be there
tomorrow from about 7 in the honour of Colin's birthday and having my viva
over and done with.  Shout if you need directions.

Do other people find this behaviour very counter-intuitive:

---cut here---
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

sub get_home ($) {
    my( $id ) = shift;

    open( PASSWD, "< /etc/passwd" ) or die $!;

    while( <PASSWD> ) {
	my( $id2, $passwd, $uid, $gid, $gecos, $home, $shell ) = split /:/;

	if( $id eq $id2 ) {
	    close( PASSWD ) or die $!;
	    return $home;
	}

    }

    close( PASSWD ) or die $!;
    return "User `$id' not found";
}

my @users = ( 'root', 'bin' );

my @homes = map { get_home( $_ ) } @users;

print "@users";
---cut here---

(Yes, I know there are better ways of doing this :-) )

If you can predict what output that will produce, you're doing better
than I did for an hour...

Well, I failed to predict the output, and even when I see what it produces
I can't work out why it's doing it. Do you have the explanation?

I haven't done a complete investigation of it yet, but basically I think
it comes down to the aliasing of $_ in map { }. Something like

@list = ( 'abcde', 'fghij' );
map { $_ = substr $_, 2, 2 } ( "abcde", "fghij" ) @list;
print "@list";

will give you

cd hi

which I can see is a useful feature. The problem now occurs because
get_home in my example uses while( <PASSWD> ), which sets $_, and thus
modifies the original list.

You're implicitly overwriting $_ with the <> operation.
$_ also is the implicit iteration variable of "map" - which it localises.
All bets are off.

Simple rule: never use $_ in a sub without localising it.

I learned this a few years ago by a similar process to the one you're
using :-)

Oh, and hi, all you guys. I missed the first meeting with Randal :-(
Is there another one planned?

I came (about 7.30pm), I looked (everywhere including upstairs and the
snug), I asked (you should try asking lots of people in a pub "are you
perlmongers?" someday), I lurked near conversations, I went away again
:-(

Next time I'll need to ask things like whereabouts you normally sit, if
there are signs I should look for, or someone's mobile number.
Ah well.

Oops. We were sitting (lurking?) upstairs at the far right-hand side.
Better luck next time ... we'll try to be a bit more identifiable!

Another social meet is now in the past...

Not particularly well attended, but that may well be a function of it
being announced about 3 days beforehand at the bottom of a thread on
something completely different.

Also not helped by Ian not being able to recognise us in the Castle.
We'll have to look more geeky next time :-)

Followed the usual pattern of food, beer and other substances in the
Castle, followed by a trip back to House! for coffee (and toast and
mushrooms).

Most notable quote of the evening was from the late arriving MBM:

"Oh, /you're/ Becky Corlett!"

Will you dare to brave the next meet?

Keep Perling...

Phil

No, mine for not saying I was definitely coming, and not asking how to
recognise you. Not that I'll refuse the offer, mind you :-)

Oh, dear. Departed puss? You do get attached to them... I have never

They're a bit far away.  I'd have to pay for shipping ;-)  Speaking of
which, I'm gonna go and buy fridge marbles from Thinkgeek.  I'd give you
the URL but the interweb's b0rken.

This is so that when the men in white coats come for you, asking
"Do you have all your marbles?" you can truthfully answer "yes; they're
safely stuck to my fridge"
?

I have a small perl module that I wrote for my own purposes which solves a
commonly irritating problem: how do you automate access to sites which
require logins?

It's available at http://www.flatline.org.uk/~pete/wex/, with an example
program that drives the orange.net portal to send a text message.
I'd like it to become some sort of "Expect for the web", a generic means
of automating applications which do not lend themselves to being
automated, such as electronic banking.

Firstly, does anyone else think this is useful, or have any ides for the
API? Secondly, how should I go about working it up to something which can
be put on CPAN?

Thanks,
Pete

Basically for CPAN you want to be using MakeMaker. That's about all there
is to it. You'll probably want to email modules@perl.org about getting a
CPAN id, but apart from that...

I have always found that Net::Telnet provides all the 'send...expect'
functionality that I need for talking to various TCP services (not just
Telnet).

You *REALLY* don't want to work at that level with HTTP, it's too
complicated. You want to build on top of the LWP client libraries.

Indeed, in this case you are "expect"ing on the content of the page, not
the rest of the request. The idea being that you could look for various
forms, and fill them in automatically, while keeping any session identifiers
or cookies.

(this was the early implementation I saw of Pete's 8 or 9 months ago)

Cookies being the important thing. People have basically abandoned HTTP
authentication for professional websites because they can't override its
user interface in browsers.

Yes, that arose from an all-nighter :) I'd dug it up, removed the
reimplementation of HTML::Form, changed it from a hideous state machine
into a reasonable language, and made it follow redirects transparently.

my $wex = new Wex();

# Go to a page (similar to javascript).
$wex->location("http://www.orange.net/");

# Set a couple of inputs, as if they were typed in.
$wex->input('usr', $USER);
$wex->input('pwd', $PASSWORD);

# Click on the first submit button found in the form last
# touched. Note that there are two forms on the orange page,
# the first of which is a search one which we don't want.
$wex->click();

etc.

Does it do anything that webchat can't do? If so, would it be easier to
patch webchat?

Oops. I had mis-read the original mail and hadn't got around to looking
at the module itself. It doesn't do what I thought it did, so please
ignore my remark about Net::Telnet. I agree with Tony about interfacing
with HTTP.

A question form a cohort:

"Know of any comprehensive descriptions of when Perl uses integers to
represent numbers, when it uses floats, how to get between them, and what
various operators (eg bitwise) do in each case? I've found hints in the
perlfaq and other stuff but nothing that fully answers my questions."

man perlop - /^ *Integer Arithmetic$/
man integer

Sums it up quite well, but omits to mention 'hex' and 'oct'.

Bitwise ops will work as if a bitstring if each arg is a string.
Note that  '12'&'8' is different from 12&8.

I detect a misunderstanding of Perl philosophy - most of the time, you
don't *care* how perl represents things. If you think you do, you're
making a mistake; if an operand needs an integer, it gets one.

Ahh, *that*'s why I didn't recognise you in the pub :-)

Internally, Perl represents all numbers as floats. Perl 6 will have
native integer types.

int(...) will truncate a number towards zero.
POSIX::floor and POSIX::ceil give you (respectively) the integers less
than or equal to and greater than or equal to a number.

Generally, The Right Thing(tm). Those operators for which a fractional
part makes no sense will have it removed.

I know it's your birthday, but that's just plain bollocks! :-)

man perlguts and look for SvIV and SvNV.

Will turn it into an SV with a set SvIOK.

Yes, and they return something which will set SvIOK.

> > and what various operators (eg bitwise) do in each case?

Bitwise ops will only work on SvIV parts. So an SvNV part will be cast
to an integer (and the SV will become SvIOK).

Perl's internal representations of things are really not for the
faint-hearted and the way the string and atoi() etc magic are done is
absolutely horrid.

And the SV SvNOK flag unset, and the SvIOK flag set.

Are you sure about this?  man perlnumber on 5.6.1 claims to use three
reprsentations; native integer, native float and string.

If it didn't use native integers, what would be the point of 'use
integer' ?

Errr... no (as MBM's pointed out :-) ). I was thinking more from a user
point of view, rather than an internals point of view. But that's still
wrong, and does beg the question why I wrote "internally"...

If it is in range for an VI, else:

 perl5.6.1 -MPOSIX -MDevel::Peek -e '$a = 2**32 + 3.7; $b = floor ($a); Dump $a; Dump $b'
SV = PVNV(0x169048) at 0x1f55d8
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (NOK,pNOK)
  IV = 0
  NV = 4294967299.7
  PV = 0
SV = NV(0xfa958) at 0x195758
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (NOK,pNOK)
  NV = 4294967299

oh, hangon, even if it  is in range for an IV:

perl5.6.1 -MPOSIX -MDevel::Peek -e '$a = 2**30 + 3.7; $b = floor ($a); Dump $a; Dump $b'
SV = PVNV(0x169048) at 0x1f55d8
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (NOK,pNOK)
  IV = 0
  NV = 1073741827.7
  PV = 0
SV = NV(0xfa958) at 0x195758
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (NOK,pNOK)
  NV = 1073741827

5.8 doesn't actually change this much for floor.

on 5.6.x and earlier.
5.8 will only mark this scalar as publicly IOK if it was really exactly an
integer.

Does 5.7.x still count as absolutely horrid?
If so, how could it be done less horribly and still work?

Win a prize:

I'll buy a pint (of bitter or cider or maybe even lager if you sweet talk me)
for anyone who finds a bug in the 5.7.2 numeric code.
I'll buy (at least) another pint if you supply a patch to fix it.

We (or, more accurately, you) have a choice of Tuesday 11th or Sunday
16th.  Next year we'll work out a regular monthly meeting day to reduce
(abundant) confusion.

No. Neither could I read it in non-transliterated form. Magic?

Ho ho.

Has anyone else been browsing the google historical archives.

http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html

Particularly of note is the post from a real nerd about the 'new' star
wars movie. What a star wars geek. Crikey,if I'd made a post like that,
I'd be asking them to remove it from the index of notable posts.

I wonder if he still can't wait until 1997 for all 9 movies.

Cheers,
Jasper

ps the answer is 'A New Hope'. Do I win a prize.
pps in case anyone thinks that this is OT, look at who that geek is.

I've received a complimentary copy of O'Reilly's 'Begining Perl for
Bioinformatics' book by James Tisdall.  I'm planning on reading and
reveiwing it over the Xmas hols, but let me know if you want to borrow it.

Erm...yes, we were going to have a December meeting.  Um.

If people want to come to my house slightly-warming, then they're welcome.
Stupidly, I don't have a copy of the invite, but it's PBAB, PBAF, PBAC, and
is at 155 Gilbert Road on this Saturday at party o'clock which is, you know,
8 - 10 start and until whenever it might finish.

I appologise if this mail seems a little seedy in some way: it's because
I've been programming in Visual Basic all day -- fortunately I'm getting
danger money for it.

Dan-Warming Party
-----------------
15 December (this saturday),
Relativity (155 Gilbert Road),
Party o'clock.

A mini house-warming to mark my joining of the merry band at Relativity, and
to put a couple more cobs on the fire of the already warm house. :)

"And, I say unto you, this party shall be founded upon three inviolable 
principles, which all may bring according to their wont: Friends, Bottles,
Desserts."

Dan.

The easiest way to get to Relativity from almost anywhere is to go to
Mitcham's Corner (the one with Staples on it), find Milton Road, and
go down it to the first set of lights by the school. The turning at
these lights is Gilbert Road. 155 is quite a long way down on the left
hand side. Quicker, more complicated, routes exist from many parts of
town.

And various cam.pm types did actually make their way there, resulting in
at least one bit of Perl:

#!/bin/sh
perl -le'$"="";$;="@ARGV";@_=map{$;=~s;$_;;gi||0}qw(l o v e s);do{@_=split"",
"@_";$_[$_]=$_[$_]+$_[$_+1]foreach 0..@_-2;$#_--}while("@_">100);print "@_%"' $*

Exactly what that does may require some explanation... do you remember
being at primary school and trying to work out how much person X loves
person Y using various scientific methods? The above will use the
following well-known[1] method:

* Write down both names (eg `Philip Kendall' and `his ego')
* Write down (in order) the number of `l's, `o's, `v's, `e's and `s's in
  both words:             [ 3 1 0 2 1 ]
* Add up adjacent digits: [  4 1 2 3  ]
* Repeat                  [   5 3 5   ]
                          [    8 8    ]
* Treat as a percentage => 88%

(If the sum of two digits is greater than 10, just treat the two digits
 as two separate entries in the array. This can cause the the procedure
 not to converge...)

[1] FSVO `well-known'.

Hmm.  According to this algorithm, I'm totally in love with anyone

What you need to do now is something to stop i going on forever if it's
not showing any sign of converging.

I've been picking this apart by email with Phil already :-)

 9   9   9
  1 8 1 8
 1 9 9 9 8

is a good example of a fragment which will never converge and get longer
and longer.  Other bits get into loops where you go round the same few
lines over and over again.  It's harder to just make an example of that
up off the top of my head I'm afraid.

I spent a week one boring summer doing lots of examples on paper and
seeing where problems were likely to occur.  There were certainly some
patterns, where specific things would make a sequence less likely to
converge.  The more of each letter there is the worse, more so if
they're in the middle than if they're at the ends.  My full name with 4
Es in is awkward.  But there were some that just failed despite looking
perfectly likley to succeed.

I can't remember any details though unfortunately.

33333 -> 6666 -> 121212 -> 33333

Those are pretty easy to catch (something like an appropriately
obfuscated `die 'Loop detected' if $seen{"@number_array"}++' in the do
loop).

Infinitely growing sequences are harder (and unfortunately, more
common...)

Is there a string length after which it is certain that the string will
expand infinitely?

No (tried that already :-) )

Or Phil. <grin>

and LNR is totally in love with anyone with no LOVE or S in their name.
Like RJK, how convenient ;-) I noticed this one when I was still at
school and considered it rather convenient.

Forgot to read Phil's perl here carefully enough to check that he'd
included the 100% case in this version, his original had left it out for
conciseness.

Ahh - but would you want to love someone with no LOVE?

Oh, and I suggest this, which is also happy with an earlier perl:

#! /usr/bin/perl
$"='';@a=map{eval"\L'@ARGV'=~y/$_//"}qw/l o v e s/;do{print "@a\n";@b=@a;shift@b;@a=map{$_+shift@a}@b}while"@a">100;print"@a%\n";

I wonder whether there is some cleverness you can do looking for trends
in the number of digits, rather than the digits themselves?

Or are there cases where the number of digits increases for a while and
then finally converges?

I was just gonna say that.  Obviously I should have got into work earlier

And see if eventually you get a pattern of 1's and 0' which, arranged

I was smoking rather too much of a particular plant (hint: not tobacco),
and the picture that came into my mind upon reading the text I've reinstated
was "Yeah, man, I see a circle in those ones and zeros". However, the party
was our office party, and was at the bunker, so even if my mind has been
adversely affected by the consumption of this substance, I did get to see
the bunker. :-)

If you want to understand this genetics lark, then watch the Royal
Institute Christmas lectures on Channel 4, given by John Sulston (former
Director of the Sanger Centre).

Further random musings: the only way in which a zero can appear in the
string is via two digits summing to 10; hence it's not possible to get
two consecutive zeros in the string, except when beginning the
procedure, and they go away.

Therefore my example above isn't particularly relevant.

Can anyone find a sequence of length >= 8, not containing two
consecutive zeros which converges? (I hear Mr. Brute Force calling...)

Phil (sorry, did someone mention Perl?)

Dear london.pm@london.pm.org,

I got this from a friend!!!!  It came from the interweb!!!!!!  It must
be tr00!!!!

--N@!!

---start-infinitely-forwarded-message---

Damian and Dan are cute kids.  They smile and wave when you enter the
room.  But in 2003 they won't be smiling.  See, Damian and Dan are
dying.  They have a fatal disease called ovacheveritis, which speeds
up their metabolism and shortens their lifespan.  In less than 18
months, they'll be nothing but a greasy stain on a coroner's floor.

But Damian and Dan have a dream.  With only one year left to live, the
Make A Dream Corporation AG GMBH Inc. Co. Ltd. has offered them each a
one year for Perl and Parrot development.  You should have seen how
their little faces lit up when they heard about it!

But friends, that dream is still just a dream.  They need over a
hundred and fifty thousand "postcards" to make this a reality.  You
can fill out a "postcard" for any amount by including your credit card
number in the form at:
  http://www.perl-foundation.org/index.cgi?page=donate

If this story has touched your heart, send them a "postcard".  It
doesn't matter if you can't send them a big "postcard", every
"postcard" helps.  And your company can send "postcards", too!

So forward this to everyone you know and make two cute kids very
happy, or those you love will be plagued by boils and forced to eat
their own earwax and listen to "My Sharona" until their heads explode.

Little Randal didn't forward this message and his ass ate Manhattan.
Big Tom forwarded this message and ... well, never mind.  Little Larry
didn't forward this message and his car imploded.  Big Greg forwarded
this message and married a major hottie.  Phwoa!

"POSTCARD"!  NOW!  OR I'LL GET GEORGE BUSH TO TELL TONY BLAIR TO
INVADE YOUR FUCKING LIVING ROOM!  IT'S FOR THE KIDS!

How painful is it to make a machine Win/Linux dual boot  (apart from
finding another license)?  It would make my research soooo much easier.
Anyone got any convincing arguments for my superiors?

Generally, not very; a quick look reveals three apparently maintained
mini-HOWTOs on the subject:

Prepend with `http://www.mcc.ac.uk/Documentation/linux-doc/HOWTO/mini/'

Install-Strategies/index.html (May 2001)
Linux+WinNT.html (Nov 2001)
Loadlin+Win95-98-ME.html (Feb 2001)

(There's also a GRUB one, should you be using that instead of LILO)

Some people on this list may try to persuade you to install BSD instead,
though :-)

---------- Forwarded message ----------

'Twas the night before release date and all through the house,
not a program was working, not even a browse.
The Programmers hung by their cubes in despair,
with hopes that a miracle soon would be there.
The users were nestled all snug in their beds,
while visions of working code danced in their heads.
When out in the lobby there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.
And what to my wondering eyes did appear,
but a super programmer with a six-pack of beer.
His resume glowed with experience so rare,
he turned out great code with a bit-pushers flair.
More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,
and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.
On Menu, On Report, On Procedures And Delete,
On Monitor, On Batch-jobs, On Functions Complete.
His eyes were glazed over, fingers nimble and lean,
from weekends and nights spent in front of a screen.
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
soon made it clear we had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
turning specs into code; then he turned with a jerk;
And laying his finger upon the enter key,
the software came up and worked perfectly.
The menues, they menued, the deletes they deleted,
the reports they reported, and the batch-jobs completed.
He tested each whistle, and tested each bell, with nary a stack dump, and all
had gone well.
The software was finished, the tests were concluded.
Our users' last minute requests were included.
Then the users exclaimed with a snarl and a taunt,
IT'S JUST WHAT WE ASKED FOR, BUT NOT WHAT WE WANT!

I think it depends where you start from.  Starting from scratch it's
pretty straightforward IMLE.  Starting from a working windows install
and adding Linux without breaking it seems to have worked fine too,
given I had a spare partition set aside for this just in case.  Both of
these were as a complete newcomer to installing linux at all.

I gather it's harder to start from a working Linux install and add
Windows, but I could be wrong.  I've not tried that myself.

Given your choice of loop variables, you could make that quite
entertaining by sticking a sort() or two inside the loop ...

Searching about motorbikes, would you believe...  I typed someone's name
into Google and got some completely irrelevant hits, of which one happened
to be a listings page including a link here.

And again in English...? (for those of who have just had champagne and are

He's using $a and $b as the loop variables. When you call sort(), it
calls the subroutine you give it as the comparison method with $a and $b
(in the current package) set to the two items it's comparing. Having now
tested it, it does at least localize $a and $b first, so it won't
clobber the loop unless you do something really inventive, but the name
clash would certainly add to the confusion.

My loop variables were $a and $b (although in fact, they end up being the 
same variable, as kindly pointed out by PAK). So if you use sort, they
end up being localised, and you can do interesting things with them.

eg @foo=sort {lc($a) cmp lc($b)} @bar; to do a case-insensitive sort.

or, if you want to sort on reverse domain parts, from a list of email
addresses:

@foo=sort {lc(join(".",reverse split/\./,($a=~/^[^@]+@(.*)/)[0])) cmp
           lc(join(".",reverse split/\./,($b=~/^[^@]+@(.*)/)[0]))} @bar;

www.camels-camels.com informs me the scientific name for the Dromedary
(one humped) camel is Camelus dromedarius.  www.llamapaedia.com tells me
the scientific name for a llama is Lama glama.  The NCBI's taxonomy
database tells me the camel and llama are cousins.  If you're confused,
you missed the vital conversation at the last London.pm social meet.

Depends how much you want to run each OS, but one approach not mentioned
is to use a bootable cdrom with linux on it. I think that most
commercial distros come with one. No permission needed :-)

BTW2 - if your disk has working Linux, and you have made a DOS partition
with the linux fdisk, then MSW will install into that one. You'll need
to make a LILO floppy beforehand, since your boot sector will be
blatted.

I did this, and found the boot-floppy-to-boot-linux sufficiently
convenient (only adds a few seconds to boot time) that I never did get
round to making a magic LILO boot. Plus, you remove the floppy, and it's
a pure windows machine, honest.

NASA'S MISSION CONTROL TO HELP SANTA

     NASA flight controllers in Houston will transform
themselves into Santa's helpers this Christmas Eve, guiding
the jolly soul on his appointed rounds.

With the assistance of the International Space Station crew
in orbit, space station flight controllers in NASA's Mission
Control will monitor Santa's speed, reindeer performance and
cargo of presents for children throughout the world.

"With three people living on the space station, we have a
unique vantage point to help Santa on his rounds," said Matt
Abbott, flight director. "We have Yury Onufrienko, Dan Bursch
and Carl Walz on board the station ready to help us out with
real-time Santa sightings, and our flight control team is
ready for this opportunity."

Mission Control Houston, home to legendary flight directors
and expert flight control teams, will for a short time this
Christmas Eve become "Santa Control, Houston."

"Santa Control, Houston" will be shown on NASA Television
during the NASA Video File December 24, which will air at
noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. EST. NASA TV is available on
GE2, transponder 9C. The frequency is 3880 MHz with an
orbital position of 85 degrees West Longitude, with audio at
6.8 MHz.

More information on the Expedition Four crew and the
International Space Station can be found on the Internet at:

             http://spaceflight.nasa.gov

I recently installed Windows 98 after Linux (SuSE 7.2) without too much tro=
uble.

The first thing I did was create a DOS7/Win98 boot disk with some useful st=
uff on it (fdisk, format, etc.) and use it to create a FAT32 partition (you=
 do have some space on your hard disk, don't you?).  Then from Linux I copi=
ed the contents of my Win98 CD across to this partition.

Back in DOS I ran the Win98 setup program and everything worked perfectly, =
except that Win98's setup overwrites the MBR, so LILO didn't get run at boo=
t any more.  This was easily fixed by booting from the SuSE install CD, whi=
ch offers the option of booting an existing installation, once I was back i=
n Linux I could run LILO and replace the MBR.

I think it depends where you start from.  Starting from scratch it's
pretty straightforward IMLE.  Starting from a working windows install
and adding Linux without breaking it seems to have worked fine too,
given I had a spare partition set aside for this just in case.  Both of
these were as a complete newcomer to installing linux at all.

I gather it's harder to start from a working Linux install and add
Windows, but I could be wrong.  I've not tried that myself.

I use Mandrake 8.1 and have done it both ways round several times. 
Installation and setting up the dual boot is pretty easy as long as you 
have clean disks to work with.   It's harder but not impossible to do it 
on occupied disks.

To re-install the dual boot after windows has trashed it I just do an 
update instead of install  from the Linux installation disks and it 
sorts it all out. Not sure what the other Linux flavours do.

Of course, the /much/ easier way to do this is to install LILO to
the linux root partition, as opposed to the MBR. This way, after you
install Windows, you can use DOS fdisk to set the linux root
partition as active, and you'll get LILO back.

Here's a picture:       +------+
                      .-+ Hurd |
                     /  +------+
                  +-+----+   +-------+
              o---+ LILO +---+ Lunix |
+-----+     /     +-+----+   +-------+
| MBR +---o          \
+-----+     \     +---+---------+
              o---+ DOS / NTLDR |
                  +-------------+

Thus adding your secondary or tertiary OS is just as easy
irrespective of the order you do it in. DYS?

There's no such thing as off-topic.  And besides, it's Christmas.  We
could persuade Colin to visit his Belfast relatives and stowaway ion the
boot...?

Well the only thing to say to that is:

Another alternative is to use something like Win4Lin or VMWare to run
Windows under Linux (or the other way around, with VMWare, which can do
both).  Costs a bit of money, but it's a solution I use at home.

Games tend not to run well or at all under Windows this way, but if
that's acceptable, this solution works quite well.  I use Win4Lin at
home to run MS Office and IE, and it works a treat.  Costs about 50
from Amazon.  VMWare is more expensive (and slower), but more flexible.

Registration is now open for this year's YAPC::Europe which is on in
Munich just before the Oktoberfest (how convenient) ;-)


----- Forwarded message from Richard Foley <Richard.Foley@t-online.de> -----

# $Id: call-for-participants,v 1.5 2002/01/24 11:16:45 yapc Exp $

Call For Participation YAPC::Europe::2002 - September 18-20

Registration is open from January 2002

	http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/registration.html

Conference fee is set at 89 Euros.

YAPC is an inexpensive 3-day grassroots perl conference, where users, and
developers, can mingle, listen, talk, and exchange ideas about the perl
programming language.  This year's conference will be held in Munich,
capital city of Bavaria, (as near to the continental centre of Europe
as you can get, without spotting the sea), Germany.

There will be a mixture of short and long tutorials and talks, covering
a wide variety of subjects.  This year's theme is 'The Science of Perl',
which means that we talk about science as well as everything else :-)

A huge variety of speakers and subjects on our favourite language is
gathering in Munich in 2002:  The author of perl, Larry Wall, is slated
to attend his first European YAPC, Damian Conway, perl evangelist and
speaker par-excellence, will also be participating, among many others.

We look forward to seeing you there too!

Call for Papers has been sent out and is available from the web site.

Note that because the number of participants is limited to 500,
(and particularly because the Oktoberfest has been planned to take
place directly after our conference), this time of year in Munich is
expected to be quite busy, therefore early booking for both conference
and accommodation is advisable.

Upstairs and to the right (if a table is available).  In case I forget to
take my orangutan/camel, I'll make it easy for you and wear my bright purple

How many other people here:
a) read fwp@perl.org (fun with perl)
b) are crazy enough to have tried the current game[1]

For any who answer yes to both, I'm now down to 83.

If noone else is doing it, I'll share my solutions here.

I've been a bad boy, and spent most of today on it. I was at 94 or so
this morning, and I rethought what I was doing, to get it to 81.

I will tell you that that is split as: 54/27 (which is not supposed to be
on the main leaderboard).

Cool. It's made me rethink about the rules for barewords particularly.

Some of you have probably noticed I'm attached at the hip to an O'Reilly
rucksack-type-thing in which I carry around my life and which is now
falling apart at the seams.  Given that I can't afford to go back to
the conference just to get a new one, and I don't do geek t-shirts very
often, I'm looking for another geek bag I can wear with pride.  I've had
no joy from geekstyle or thinkgeek.  Any ideas?

I'm going to say, for the record, that Stephen Turner is an *evil* *evil*

#!perl -nl
$x=$.%2;map{$x^=4*2**index aeiouy,$_}/./g;$x||print

is way nastier than my meta-program solution of:

#!perl -n
($a=aeiouy)=~s##|||y|#g;1&eval"$.|y|a-z$a||"||print

and you were only one character behind me. :-)

It's fairly easy to turn the eval into a print and see how mine works,
for example.

The Camel Bags site itself (www.cameltrophy.com) is a piece of Flash

It's much easier when you've seen people who got lower solutions than
yourself. In my case, it also helped to read the rules.

Really?? I think mine is the model of transparency compared to yours. A
program that generates a program is always obscure. Even when you've printed
the string out, you have to work out what it does, with all those |'s in.

Mine on the other hand is entirely obvious. Just xor with 2^n when you see
the nth vowel. How can that be complicated?

I think you mean 4<<index. But it doesn't work. index can be -1 and we need
to count those too. 4<<(-1) doesn't give 2.

I could however have saved a stroke with
  $x^=4*2**index aeiouy,$_ for/./g
in place of the middle expression.

I've never actually done anything with Per/Tk.  What's it like?


---------- Forwarded message ----------

FROM TK NEOPHYTE TO TK EXPERT--
O'REILLY RELEASES "MASTERING PERL/TK"


Sebastopol, CA--Like the pairing of fine wine and food, some things are
just meant to go together. Early Perl users who had to be content with
command-line interfaces or full-screen interfaces using Curses or
similar systems, were delighted with the splitting off of the Tk widget
library from the Tcl language, because it opened a whole new world to
Perl. Using Tk's flexible and friendly widget set, Perl programmers
could now create graphical interfaces for their programs. Buttons,
menus, dialog boxes, scrolled text areas, and more could be used to add
a little flair and professionalism to Perl applications. In "Mastering
Perl/Tk" (O'Reilly, US $44.95), veteran authors and Perl/Tk users,
Steve Lidie and Nancy Walsh, introduce Perl/Tk and show how to build
attractive, intuitive interfaces for Perl programs.

Written for novices and seasoned Perl/Tk programmers alike, "Mastering
Perl/Tk" begins with a fast-moving tutorial that covers the basics on
how to use Perl/Tk, including a discussion of all the basic widgets and
the geometry managers that determine how each widget is laid out. The
book then branches out into advanced applications of Perl/Tk, with a
series of extensive program examples that will take even experienced
programmers to the next step in learning how to program elegantly and
effectively in Perl/Tk.

"This book evolved from my earlier book "Learning Perl/Tk," explains
Walsh. "The response to that book made it clear that there were many
avid and loyal Perl/Tk users, but readers also let us know that they
wished the book showed advanced techniques, covered some nonstandard
widgets, and included more extended examples of Perl/Tk programming."
Walsh and Lidie worked together to double the size of the book and
change its title to reflect the new expansion, and the baby emu on the
cover of the earlier book grew into the adult emu on the cover of the
current book.

Although Perl/Tk is very popular, the lack of a complete, comprehensive
book on the topic has made it difficult for programmers to locate a
central source of information. In "Mastering Perl/Tk," Lidie and Walsh
go into detail on creating custom widgets, working with bindings and
callbacks, IPC techniques, and offer many examples of nonstandard
add-on widgets for Perl/Tk, including Tix widgets. This book is sure to
be the definitive guide that every Perl/Tk programmer will need.

Perl/Tk" may be found at:

Horrid.

It is trying to be object-oriented, but because of the underlying way
that Tk works, it breaks many things about objects that you might
otherwise expect. Oh and it's event driven, so trying to work out what
a given code path will be is not always obvious, in anything reasonably
complex. :-)

That's just my opinion, though. :-)

I have used it (with/via GLADE) to protoype a user interface and it was
good for that.

I wouldn't have done it without using Glade, since that handles all of
the UI design stuff for you and just spits out the UI code which you
then don't have to touch.

Drawing to the canvas widget is very slow, so wouldn't use it for
anything that needs fast graphics, but great for a small app such as a
UI front end to a command line or a config tool.

Cool for hacking quick GUIs, event driven so you have to design things a bit
different. I used it for a cross-platform installer, don't ask me about
using it on Windows (spit)

There have been rumblings for a while, but brian d foy and co have
released the first issue of a new perl magazine.

See http://www.perl.org/ThePerlReview/

(I could be tempted to write a 'Four go mad at a beer festival' (last
weekend in Manchester) article, if I remembered to rescue my beer list
from MBM ;-))

Not perl, but never mind.
A new sport: Googlewhacking.
The challenge - find two English words that, when combined into a
search, produce the magical result "Results 1 - 1 of 1".

I offer 'petunia carabiners' - whose function is known to all Douglas
Adams fans.

Sadly, not. Those quotes make it too easy - wombat fenstration has 10
matches by my count. And, if anything, selfgooglewhacking is easier -
you find a zero (there are plenty of those), put up a page, and wait a
bit.

I knew it was too good to be true.  Having arranged a nice schedule for
social meetings (this was going to be a reminder for one on Wednesday)
I've just got round to reading NTK and am reminded that Dave Green is
coming to talk to the Uni Computer Society (CUCS).

So, unless anyone has any objections, I suggest rendezvousing in The
Anchor on Silver Street from 6.30ish and heading to the nearby Hopkinson
lecture theatre for 8.30, followed by more pub (subject to confirmation
by the CUCS boss who should be lurking round here somewhere).

We generally head to the Anchor afterwards, at the moment. We've sometimes
even been able to get a table there.

For anyone who's going to this, there will be pancakes at my flat afterwards.

(it's about a mile or so walk from qmw) I can probably even offer some crash
space.

What do people consider to be a tasteful way of implementing a dynamically
extensible script? I'm thinking along the lines of a library directory
which is scanned by the script, and files in that directory may attach
to hooks in the script to add functionality. The user should be able to
add hook files or library dirs at run-time, of course.

(My script outputs code, and for a given code fragment a hook file would
output its own specialized variation according to the metaobject protocol
that the hook file is helping to implement. Multiple versions of the
same code coexist and are called in slightly differing circumstances.)

Tony.

Certainly eval would probably help you here, I suspect there is probably
some magic in DynaLoader that will help you too. CPAN.pm can do something
similar to this (if you can find anything useful in the module), when you
call "reload cpan".

The AutoLoader may be able to help you too. In Perl5.6.1, there's also a
cunning trick with @INC, you can push a coderef onto @INC, and it returns
the name of the file to load for a given .pm file. By doing this, and
unsetting the relevant module in %INC, you may be able to achieve the
effect you want, in a slightly neater way.

Would I be correct in remembering that the Anchor doesn't do food?

If anyone wants to come along but is afraid of getting lost I can lurk in
a convenient pub beforehand.  But you'll have to let me know otherwise
I'll lurk in my even more convenient department and hack perl.  Pub
afterwards is a given ;-)

Subject: CUCS talk, Wednesday 13th February, Speaker: Dave Green

This week's CUCS talk will be delivered by Dave Green, editor of UK
internet newsletter "NTK" (http://www.ntk.net/).

"Exploitable Vulnerabilities In The Mainstream And Technology Media" -

  Do you need to actually hack someone else's computer to get your
  name in the papers? Or are journalists still dumb enough to believe
  any old mad tech-related story? (and featuring hilarious true-life
  examples!)

The talk will take place this Wednesday (the 13th) at 8:30 in the
Hopkinson
lecture theatre, the location of which is shown here:

http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v3/drawmap.cgi?mp=nmus;xx=137;yy=312;mt=c;tl=Hopkinson%20Lecture%20Theatre

The doors are locked out of hours, so a committee member will be present
to let you in. Please try to be on time, as access after the talk starts
may be impossible.

You can catch us in the Anchor from about 10pm if you miss the talk.

OK, not that interesting, but more interesting than tidal heating of
global clusters :-)

Given that you've posted it here, it presumably will be soon enough. :-)

Which reminds me, if colon feels a bit happier, and stops bouncing due
to (probably) broken memory, then I might merge the REDESIGN branch of
the website to the head over the weekend.

If anyone else is interested the new website is currently on display as
http://beta.cam.pm.org/

Nice, but it's TMTOWTDI not TIMTOWTDI!

Bah. Generalise. I'll assert there's more than one way to spell

I duno what or when or how.  I only know pub.  I'll try and herd him
there.  Reminds me - must turn mobile on.   Is it my lack of sleep or is
that subject line crack-induced?

And as a quick off-topic-er, so I can finish off the stuff I stayed up all
night for, how do I mount a remote file system when it requires
login?

I came, I failed to see, I went away again.

I loitered around until about 7:30 but failing to see (or indeed speak to)
Lucy or anyone else I knew I blagged a lift to the station and set off for
home.

Which is a shame as I was looking forward to it.

'Til the next time...

Can you owe me beer too, even though I went to see ESR (a mistake, I think,
I should have come up to cambridge instead). Let it be known that ESR has
an ego that extends arbitrarily far in any direction, and is generally a
pratt.

I looked at the title of the talk and concluded that it would be exactly
the same as the one he gave a few years ago when "Open Source" was a dodgy
spin-doctoring of the term "Free Software" and when the web hadn't yet
made the Jargon File look horrifically inaccurate as well as biased.

RMS, on the other hand, has changed: his hair is tidier and only just
goes below his shoulders, his beard is neatly trimmed, and he can talk
interestingly about copyright as applied to stuff other than software.

Sorry you didn't spot us in the pub, Simon. I have to admit that I wasn't
there until 20:00ish...

Tony.

OK. After it having sat around for a number of months, I've finally taken
the new cam.pm website live. I'm still looking for people to maintain it,
to take some of the load off Phil, who's currently doing all the work that
gets done on it.

I note that "projects" is empty. 

It'd be nice to have a project to produce a `ucamcron', that is, a thing
which converts some specification in the University Calendar system
("third wednesday of Michaelmas term") into a valid crontab system.

Is there an algorithmic description of when terms start? I know that
the Michaelmas term usually starts on the first Thursday in October,
but Easter causes amusing havoc with the Lent and Easter terms, both
Full Term and Term in the longer sense (er, ENOENT for the name).

I recently bought a facinating book called "Calendrical Calculations"
published by CU Press, which contains Lisp code for lots of weird
and wonderful calendars as well as common-or-garden ones, so fitting
University terms into its framework would seem to be a good project.
(It's also missing the Shire Reckoning, which seems to be a dire
omission, especially since (despite its seeming simplicity) it has
some unique features.) I think the Oxford Companion to the Year
will have to be acquired to keep it company on the shelf...

Tony.

AIUI, Term is nearly algorithmic, but Full Term is tabulated. See
  http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/termdates.html

NB "Week n" has no formal definition, and seems to be used in different ways
by different people.

I would always use Week 1 to be the period of 7 days starting on the
Thursday when 1A Natural Sciences students have their first maths
lecture of Full Term. Everything else follows from there...

That's the standard NatSci definition. I don't think most (any?) other
people think in terms of weeks that start on Thursdays though.

Only one hour? The rest of us are in the process of losing 168 hours.

The next social is due to be held in the Castle Inn (surprise, surprise)
on Friday, 8th March.  I'll attempt to get there early and bag an upstairs
table.  Alternatively, look the geek t-shirts and cuddly toys.  Note that
this date clashes with london.pm (7th) but avoids the end of term binge
(15th).

In what way is that a clash? I'll probably go to both. :-) If I can find
somewhere to stay in cam for saturday and sunday, that is. :-)

Well, that's 'clashes' as in 'close', unlike Ox.pm who managed to have
one on the same night as a social, fools.

I don't know if any Londoners will make it up, mind. Doubt it, to be
honest.

It's the bits where you spend four hours improving your solution not one
stroke which can really get annoying... (thankfully, haven't though
about it today, and about to go to the pub...)

How does it clash? How long a hangover were you planning on having?
(not sure if I will make it. 5.7.3 is out and there aren't that many hacking
weekends until the code freeze. And there are things I'd like to have in 5.8.)

In that Nodnolers won't want to go to the pub two days running.  What am I
saying?!  Rather, they won't want to come to Cambridge.  Cos we're evil.

BoB (unsurprisingly, as it's run by the referees), followed by Mtv

And Stephen Turner to 54, I see! When I saw you one ahead of
Eugene I thought it must be a misprint. Actually, Stephen is
my dark horse tip to win the tournament. Why?

Tee hee.

Still, this morning's leaderboard makes me feel a bit out of my depth. I was
only 2 strokes behind last night, but now Ton's shot an eagle and a couple
of birdies to leave me 6 off the pace. I might be worth a punt at 50-1 if
you fancy backing an outsider, but don't accept any shorter odds. :-)

I thought that weeks formally began on Tuesday but that everyone
(even the dwindling band of students not under the ever-expanding bosom of
the School of the Physical Sciences) treated them as starting on Thursday
due to the lecture timetable?

Actually, I think the Lecture Timetable issues of the Reporter might
provide an answer on the Tuesday vs Thursday thing, as they specify days
in terms of week numbers and week days.

Something Oxford manages to do more sensibly, with weeks starting on
Sundays in all contexts.  Though admittedly full term starts on Thursday
of 0th week :-)

I am working on a project to build a website and am looking for someone
to do some contract work. Would like to work with someone local to the
area.

Look at www.invisible.uk.net/website.htm if interested.

Needs a mixture of Perl, PHP and experience with using mapinfo or
similar.

If I recall correctly, various University dramatic organisations (the
ADC Theatre and ADC Club in particular) use (or at least used to use)
this definition.  The week in which lectures start is week 0, and full
term then runs through weeks 1 to 8 with lectures finishing during week
8.

lol.  I guess this would all make more sense if I actually knew golf.  Is
it more complicated than the offside rule? ;-)

In this case I suspect it's rather more like Mornington Crescent than golf.

See Oxford does it better than that: lectures start on Monday of week 1
and end on Friday of week 8 (no Saturday lectures there!).  Undergrads
must arrive by Thursday 0th week and usually leave Saturday 8th.
Nothing much really happens in 0th week except possibly some college
based exams (collections) and a meeting with your Tutors (Supervisors)
to arrange this term's timetable.

Hi All,

I'm not too sure if this is the right Ng to make this posting however, if it 
isn't I'd be grateful if you
could point me to the appropriate Ng for this post. I'm a recent convert to 
Perl, and I find the community
spirit very, very encouraging and admirable.

OK guys and girls,

I am working on a project (I developed it mostly in C/C++) and I would like 
to add Perl scripting to it,
and I would also like to expose some of my C functions to Perl (i.e write a 
Perl module that provides access
to my C functions). I have read some docu on Perl guts and SWIG and it seems 
like a pretty steep learning
curve to me (I need to finish this by the end of March). Plus, it would be 
much more time efficient to
enlist the help of one of the many Perl Gurus out there, to help me put this 
together as quickly as possible.

To sunmmarise, this is what I need help with :


a) Embedding the Perl interpreter in my application
   (I've already done this, but I need some further help with graceful
   exits when an error occurs, as well as a means of returning the error 
description
   [when something goes wrong]. Currently, my application crashes outright 
if something
   is wrong with my Perl script).

b) Opening an internet connection (i.e. dialing an ISP and logging on from a 
Perl script)

c) Downloading files from the internet and various ftp sites

d) Processing the files (one of them is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet)

e) Storing the processed data into a database

f) Generating an error report and sending it via e-mail to a provided e-mail 
address

g) Closing the internet connection (i.e logging off from the ISP)

h) Familiarity of using SWIG to automate the build of a SWIG interface file
  (for building the Perl module, based on my C functions)



Now for the best part ;-)

I don't expect any of you guys/girls to do this for free. I would not like 
to take advantage of the great
community spirit out there. So instead, I would like you to tell me what you 
would want to be paid for your
expenses/ time etc.

I reckon it's probably a weekend job (a full saturday or Sunday), for 
someone who knows their way around
Perl. The slightly complicated areas (for me anyway) are [a] and [h]. The 
rest are fairly standard
processes and there may even be scripts out there which do exactly this sort 
of thing. I have some perl
code I wrote, that we can chuck in, as well as some visual basic code that 
does most of the text processing,
so the logic/functional spec has been all sorted out, it's a case of 
"porting" the functionality to Perl,
which is much better at "data munging" anyway !

I would prefer whoever decides to help, to actually come and do the work on 
my computer, since we can get a
lot more done instead of mailing files back and forth and finding that 
things don't quite work because our
machines have different configurations etc, etc. Besides there'll be far too 
many header files and libs to
be passing around to even make it a practical alternative.

This is why I specify that a London programmer will be much more preferable. 
However, if you would like to
travel from anywhere (in the UK !), I will gladly pay your transportation 
expenses - I just need some help
to get this finished !. If we manage to finish this in a day (as I think we 
can), I promise to get you as
many beers as you can drink at the local pub !




Thanks for your time and please e-mail responses directly to me (not this 
newsgroup).

My email is perl_redhat_hacker@hotmail.com



BTW, my e-mail addres is a bit of a red herring (no pun intended !) I'm 
developing on Windows 2K (NOT Linux) !



Regards


Neil

People have probably noticed for some time that the archives on cam.pm have
a broken address, and I've been wanting to fix it for some time. I've now
turned from being a perl hacker to a python hacker to remove the following
offending bit of code:
|         # Figure out the e-mail address and poster's name
|         self.author, self.email = message.getaddr('From')
|         e = message.getheader('Reply-To')
|         if e is not None:
|             self.email = e
and comment out the last 3 lines

I don't think this will break anything, but as part of a test, this message
is a sort of announcement and a sort of test. :-)

I notice this header:

List-Archive: <http://cam.pm.org/pipermail/cam.pm/>

Does any mailing list software offer an archiving system that is
sufficiently integrated that it can add the URL that the message will be
archived as to the message as it passes through?

I doubt it, as I think mailman (and sensible archivers) would treat this
as a file delivery and so only work out the value for this at delivery
time.

The problem with trying to do this is that it is blurring a nice conceptual
boundary between list manager and archiver which should make the code nice
and modular...

True.

I can see two slightly hacky ways to get round that

1: mailing list manager adds some sort of monotonic increasing ID to each
   message (so it knows it) that the archiver can use as one form of indexing
or
2: archiver can do lookups by message ID. (maybe not the default way)
   which would allow the mailing list manager to provide that form of lookup
   URL to get you to the message.

While I'm on this subject, what do people think about the mailman
s/@/ (at) /g spam protection? Should I enable this for subsequent
cam.pm list archives?

We played about with both of these on (void) last year when I was
summarising it [0], and richardc, veeg and I were batting around
various ideas at YAPC::Europe last year.

In the end veeg did make a patch to pipermail so the message-ID was in
a comment in the HTML of the page, which made tying things together
much nicer. I think we dediced that the first idea (adding a
List-Suggests-Archive-URL, or something a little shorter) would have
been better, in the long run. (It would also have made summarising
easier.)

[0] I used to read through the mbox, picking out message-IDs and pasting
    them beneath the relevant block of text, then run a script to pull
    the message-IDs out of the HTML and cross-reference everything
    resulting in pages like [1] [2]
[1] http://husk.org/void/summ/
[2] although I think the (void) archives got reset after that summary...

What's the current 'best' module for doing (simple) rational arithmetic
in Perl?

Of the two obvious ones, Math::Fraction gives me warnings every time I
try and do anything with it, and Math::BigRat requires Math::BigFloat
1.28, which I can't see on CPAN :-(

TIA,

Phil

OK so suppose you're writing a small command line program which you want
to take a few options, and you don't fancy doing to option handling by
hand unless you really need to, what do you use?

The Camel book documents the Getopt::Std module, and I've been trying to
use that.  It has a couple of functions, one which takes a reference to
a hash and is supposed to populate the hash with the results, and
another which stores the results in a bunch of global variables.

I can't seem to get the former to work (any ideas where I might be
messing up?).  Ad I don't like the latter because global variables
aren't really appreciated by use strict and I can't get 'our' to work
(is this part of perl introduced later than 5.004?  Still trying to get
current stable version of perl to compile on our HPUX machines with no
success: IO've not had a huge amount of experience compiling things and
I tend to run out of ideas when it doens't just work :-).

Is there a better module out there?  Or am I just going to have to carry
on not using strict (current workaround)?  Or should I just do it
myself?  I mean it's only half a dozen options, it shouldn't be too hard
to do.

You'll want something like this:

  #! /usr/bin/perl -w
  use strict;
  use Getopt::Std;
  my %opts;
  getopts('abc', \%opts);
  print "a is set\n" if defined $opts{a};
  print "b is set\n" if defined $opts{b};
  print "c is set\n" if defined $opts{c};

Put a colon after any letter in the first argument to getopts() if you
want that option to take an argument.

'our' turned up in Perl 5.6. The usual way of using global variables
before then was 'use vars', so you would do something like:

  use vars qw($opt_a);

... if you wanted the strict module to keep quiet about $opt_a.

My usual thing goes something like this:

	use Getopt::Long;

	my %option;
	Getopt::Long::Configure 'bundling';
	GetOptions (\%option, "pipe|p!", "debug|d!")
	    or die "usage: cvslog [-d] [-p] [file ...]\n",
	           "\t-d\tdebugging output\n",
	           "\t-p\tread input from pipe\n";

	my $pipe;
	if ($option{pipe}) {
		$pipe = new_from_fd IO::Handle fileno(STDIN), "r";
		die "$0: fdopen: $!\n" unless defined $pipe;
	} else {
		$pipe = new IO::Pipe;
		die "$0: pipe: $!\n" unless defined $pipe;
		$pipe->reader("cvs", "log", @ARGV);
	}

etc.

I tried this and it worked ok for me. Watch out for the difference
betwen getopt & getopts. Code something like this:

#! /usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use Getopt::Std;

my %opts = ();

getopts('oD:I', \%opts);

foreach (keys %opts) {
    print "$_ : $opts{$_}\n";
}

Gives output of:

[simonw@neo perl]$ perl getopt -o -I -D three
o : 1
I : 1
D : three

From the man page:

       Note that, if your code is running under the recommended
       `use strict 'vars'' pragma, you will need to declare these
       package variables with "our":

           our($opt_foo, $opt_bar);

HTH,

Simon.

Damn, that's almost identical to what I'm already doing.  OK I didn't do
the check that it's defined explicitly, but I've tried printing them and
get undefined variable warnings and nothing printed :-(

I'll try again anyway.  CC'd to me at work so I don't forget and so I
can compare your syntax to mine.

Yeah, I've got that bit.

And it's a pragmata not a module stricly speaking :-)  Dunno why it
doesn't like that syntax either.  I just turn it on to check the rest
then turn it off again to shut it up in this case.

Where and how does it fail?

Also, does the development 5.7.3 snapshot fail to compile?
It is worth investigating that, because if you don't, you'll find that in
a few weeks you'll have "stable" 5.8 that doesn't compile.

[Or run your favourite modules. Or everything else you were unable to test
now and bug report as being broken by something it changed.]

Yes, this is why it was annoying me that our doesn't work, since it's
not implemented in that version of Perl.  :-P

Which version of Perl are you using? I seem to remember that the version
of Getopt::Std whch fills in a hash is a relatively new thing (one of the
5.005 series perhaps).

And if you can't use "our" because you're not using 5,6.x, then the 
alternative is to use "use vars" to predeclare your package variables.

use vars qw($a $set %of @variables);

Well there's Getopt::Long - but that's more complicated.

Perhaps you should just download and install a more up to date version
of Getopt::Std.

Ah, that will indeed be the problem then.  Thanks.  The fact I couldn't
initially get perldoc working didn't help :-)  Adding the most recent
version of Perl's directory into the beginning of my path has solved
that one thogh, so I can double check.

[5.004 is the most recent on the system.  The default perl5 is 5.001.
The default perl is still 4!]

I shall certainly give that another go.

I think I'll stick to trying to install the entirety of 5.6.1 instead:
otherwise I'll be continually trying to do things that don't exist by
the look of it, because my paper documentation is so far ahead of the
installed version.

And it seems fine now.  I must have typoed it somehow.  And by that
point I was getting frustrated enough that I might not have noticed
small errors.  Anyway my program is now a happy bunny so thankyou :-)

Anyway, I'm still going to gie compiling 5.6.1 another go later today so
I'll get back to Nick and Ian as to how useful their repies were then
:-)

Falling over when I tried to run make.  It was finding some include
files but failing others.  Telling it to look for include files in
/usr/include instead of in /usr/local/include seems to have fixed the
problem.

Not yet got as far as make install since I'm being encouraged to build
it on a less crucial machine and neither of the ones available currenly
has enough space in /opt but at least make now runs and make test
passed, which I'm taking as a good sign :-)

Is that expected soon then?  There's nothing on the downloads page to
hint at that sort of thing.

Ah good that it works.
Not good that it didn't work first time, and your description doesn't ring
any bells as to what the problem is. Are you using gcc, or the pay-for
HP-UX ANSI C compiler?

It usually is.

Yes. 5.7.3 is out. There's a link on www.perl.com (I think) as "devel is
5.7.3" Jarkko wants to freeze for 5.8 in a week or two, so hopefully it
won't be forever. It is *development* perl so you're really not advised to
install it on machines in place of whatever you're using currently. But (by
default) it won't install as /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl, just
/usr/local/bin/perl5.7.3. This means that you can use it to test your
systems without buggering the machine's regular perl. (Although, still, it
would be foolish to do this on anything other than a development system)

It would be really useful if everyone on cam.pm could test 5.7.3.

[Yes, I realise that not everyone will be able to, but if you could, please
do]

Simply because if perl5-porters doesn't learn of the bugs in 5.7.3 with your
real-world scripts, then 5.8 will still have those bugs, and that's not in
your interest.

[it's not in perl5-porters' either, really, but I'm appealing to your
selfishness]

Yes, I know that.  And that's a development version and I'm not sure how
I'm supposed to guess from the existence of a development version that
I'm meant to expect a new stable version imminently.  If I see a
download page which tells me "this is the stable version and this is the
current development version" I get the stable one, and am no wiser as to
when the next is due out.

I'm certainly not installing development versions at work anyway.

>It would be really useful if everyone on cam.pm could test 5.7.3.

Well, I could install it at home, but that really wouldn't be much of a
test since I never write perl at home to a first approximation.

It was mentioned on use.perl.org:

http://use.perl.org/articles/02/03/05/1235220.shtml?tid=6

    This is the last developer release before the major release of
    5.8.0 in April or May,

and I believe in the perl.com e-mail newsletter (although I've deleted my
copy of that, as usual)

It also got to slashdot:
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/05/2041239&mode=thread

    Perl 5.7.3 is out. This should be the last development version
    before 5.8.0 comes out in April or May.

The proposed schedule for 5.8 was also debated a bit about 2 weeks before,
and again (I think) mentioned on use.perl.org

But I agree that that's not everywhere.

No. Sorry if this is sounding rude. What I am trying to say is:

Either: Install it somewhere at work on a development system
        Test works scripts with it
Or:	Do not complain if it turns out that 5.8 does not run work's
        scripts.

(Sorry. that was a rude way of putting it)

The polite way is:

perl needs your help. 5.7.3 is almost 5.8. Please, if you are able, find out
whether 5.7.3 breaks the perl scripts and modules you rely on. If you report
problems now, they can be fixed before 5.8

If you report the problems with 5.8, you'll have to wait until 5.8.1

It's probably best to read the instructions:

http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg74215.html

I'll forward the "Internet way" to the list.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
Making over half a million ok reports every 4 to 5 months from your home for
an investment of only 10 minutes CPU time
THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !

Before you say =12Bull=13, please read the following. This is the letter you
have been hearing about on slashdot lately. Due to the popularity of this
letter on the Internet, a international mailing list recently devoted an
entire thread to the investigation of this program described below, to see
if it really can make people ok reports. The list also investigated whether=
 or
not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that
there are =12absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program
and if people can - follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make
some mega oks with only 10 minutes out of pocket cost=13. DUE TO THE RECENT
INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY
WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  This is what one had to say: =12Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I
passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and CPU required. To my astonishment, I
received total 610,470=BC ok reports in 21 weeks, with more still coming in=
.=13

Just follow these simple instructions.


  Download 5.7.3 from CPAN

  cd perl-5.7.3
  sh Configure -de -Dusedevel -Dprefix=3D/usr/local/test/perl573
  make all
  make test

and if you see the magic line:

  All tests successful.
  u=3D3.03333  s=3D3.68333  cu=3D289.5  cs=3D43.6167  scripts=3D594  tests=
=3D56364

run make ok and send your OK report back to the top address on the list bel=
ow.

But don't stop there.

  make install

This will install perl as

  /usr/local/test/perl573/bin/perl5.7.3

which won't clash with your existing perl

Now try the shiney new perl with all your favourite modules.

  /usr/local/test/perl573/bin/perl5.7.3 -MCPAN -e shell

Report any problems to the top address on this list:

  perlbug@perl.org
  perl5-porters@perl.org
  perl-porters@lists.debian.org
  perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com
  larry@wall.org
  perlbug@perl.com


Now, make a copy of this message. Remove the top address from the list.
Write your own address on the bottom of the list.
Mail the message to 5.8 of your perl using friends.

Within a few weeks you will be getting 38068.692544 ok reports all for
yourself.

Damian didn't follow these instructions. He didn't check whether his scripts
worked with 5.7.3. And when 5.8 came out a few weeks later none of his scri=
pts
worked with it. He's forced to run all his scripts on perl6.
You wouldn't want that now, would you?

Don't delay - do it today.

I just don't feel one should be expected to do extensive research into
the next stage of development of a project before installing the current
one.  If it's supposed to be obvious that we should test the development
version now then they should damned well say so rather than relying on
random word of mouth.

<Hollow laugh> The default perl is still 4.  Do you think they're really
going to care if the next version along works with their old scripts or
not?  They'll just keep on using their old perl with them.  We don't use
them for anything mission critical or public facing or anything.  And
they're employing me because they're too busy with day-to-day stuff to
upgrade *anything*.  Perl is not a high priority.

This upgrade I'm doing is only to save me the trouble of having to
continue to try workarounds for things in my copy of the Camel book and
in my head which don't exist yet as far as their system is concerned.

I understand why you would like me to do this, but it just ain't going
to happen.  I still don't have the free disk space on the non-critical
machines to finish the current install.

><Hollow laugh> The default perl is still 4.

If by this you mean that /usr/bin/perl is perl 4 then this is quite
common, because perl 5 broke lots of perl 4 scripts. In an environment
with lots of history and not enough time to do spring cleaning, it
is normal to leave /usr/bin/perl as perl 4 and have /usr/bin/perl5
for perl 5 scripts.

All modern perl scripts should start

	#!/usr/bin/perl5 -w
	use strict;

and perl people who complain that the shebang path is wrong need
to be reminded of the lifetime of software.

Tony.

[curious] Where would you think 'they' should announce that 'we' should

I've skimread bits of LotR, and read a lot of the critiques and background
material (esp the linguistics stuff). The bits of the actual book I've
read get about as far as Elrond's Council, and I've also read the bit
about the Sundering of the Fellowship towards the end of the first volume.

By a very weird coincidence, not having slept nearly enough for a few days
in December, I went to see LotR in the cinema and slept through the thing. 
I'd never realised just how camp LotR was, and found the screenplay
particularly dull (and insufficiently conformant with the book). The bits
I saw on the screen were exactly the bits I'd read in the book, and
apparently between these points I snored very loudly and disturbed the
other cinema-goers.

I went to look for perl to download.  Following the advice in the Camel
book I went to www.perl.org and and the obvious thing to do there was
click on the big shiny download button.  This took me to www.cpan.org.
Knowing I wanted to roll my own I clicked on the "source code" link.
This has links for the stable release and the current development
release and says about the latter:

"Source code for the latest development release of perl. This code has
new features and bug fixes relative to the version in stable.tar.gz;
however, it has not been in use for so long, and so has more bugs that
we do not know about. If this does not worry you, this is the version
for you. If it does worry you, then you need stable.tar.gz."

Which says to me immediately (under my circumstances) "do not use".  It
would be here that I'd expect instead a statement of the fact that while
5.6.1 was the current stable release 5.8.whatever was due any minute now
and you ought to test the development version to make sure it wouldn't
break your code.

Where do you expect me to find this out otherwise if I'm not reading
cam.pm?  I don't think I'm being unreasonable here.

It's on a Wednesday.  There's your excuse.  There is no excuse for not
coming to my party though.

Have I plugged this on here already?  Ah well, you beat me to it.

I've just read the description for this, and thoroughly approve. I've now
read further, where they talk about the constraints they're operating
under, and like them even more.

The Free Software community needs more people like the ones who are behind
this website.

It also confirms my prejudice that one of the ways of convincing pedantic
people to do something useful is to implement thw wrong thing and wait for
them to fix it :) (see KDE vs. GNOME, etc)

Oh, but let's not discuss which is "wrong" and which is "fixed" here. :-)

Seeing as this isn't my job in the first place and I really want to do
some Drosophila sex instead, I'm trying to be lazy and get one script to
do some stuff and set off lots of other (complex) scripts (with several
different parameters for each).  I've tried both system and require and
neither worked properly but that was probably just me messing up the
syntax.  Any advice is appreciated, I bow to the knowledge of cam.pm.

Did you try something like this:

	#! /usr/bin/perl -w
	
	use strict;
	
	my $cmd = "echo";
	my @args = qw(alpha beta gamma);
	
	foreach my $arg (@args)
	{
	  system("$cmd $arg");
	}

Cheers,

If they're scripts and they expect arguments, 'require' isn't really
suitable because a) you would need to poke the arguments into @ARGV
first, b) it will only run the thing the first time you called it and
c) it may well call exit() when it finishes. You probably want to run
another perl interpreter with system(), like you said.

At this point you should { warn "Command '$cmd $arg' return code was
$?" if $? } or something similar.

> 	}

Also you should know that system("string with spaces") is equivalent
to system(qw(string with spaces)) . If you want shell pipes or whatnot
you have to use the first form. If you want spaces in arguments you're
better off using the second form because there's no worrying about
where the words are split.

Like it says in 'perldoc -f system',

  See "`STRING`" in perlop and "exec" for details.

If you need the output from the scripts, you'll have to delve in the
perlipc pages.

I think what I really meant is "equivalent provided the scalar
contains no shell meta-characters". (Then it's correct, yes?)

Also, the simple scalar arg version uses execvp instead of .. whatever
the other one does. I think the implications are PATH searching,
efficiency somewhere and lying to 'ps' about what you're running. I'm
hoping Lucy doesn't care too much about these things ATM. 8-)

Oh, also $? contains other stuff as well as the return code.

Nothing. What's wrong with my brain? I think it's empty again. Maybe I
should stop trying to be helpful, at least until it refills.

Noted.  See, I tried this in the lab and it didn't work.  Now, I'm at home
where I can't do anything useful (full hard disk), it does work.  Shall
try again tomorrow and also *not* delete a day's worth of work like I did
today.  Bah.  Still, pub tomorrow *hint*

 No, it isn't.

 qw(string with spaces) is a list, so system(qw(string with spaces))
is actually equivalent to system('string', 'with', 'spaces').

 How is this different? Well, if you call system with the single
string, shell-like processing is done on it, whereas if you call
it with a list, the arguments are passed through literally.

 Compare:  perl -e 'system("echo *")'
     and:  perl -e 'system("echo", "*")'

 The other difference is that a double-quoted string does variable
interpolation, whereas qw doesn't.

No. No. No. MCA is still wrong.

Even if you have no shell meta-characters, you STILL invoke sh for the
scalar and you invoke the list directly (like an exec or similar).

THIS IS *NOT* EQUIVALENT. The effect may be, but that's a different
question.

Backticks are evil for a similar reason.

OK, I'm obviously missing something here. Are you saying that

system( "ls" );

in Perl will still call sh? If so, what's the point of the tests in
doio.c:Perl_do_exec3 (from the 5.7.3 source) looking for shell
metacharacters?

(A quick test on a Solaris box:

Oh yuck! I'm wrong. sorry.

that's quite without doubt the most disgusting bit of code I've seen in
a while. (perl5.005 version, not 5.7.3 version). This is not including

Yuck, yuck, yuck.

Sorry MCA.

 According to the Perl docs for system(), the shell is only used
if meta-chars are found. I haven't tested this.

Be more specific? Or perhaps another way, what happens if you stick
"echo" in as the first arg/at the start of the string?

 Indeed, though I have done no tests myself, the documentation
for Perl system() indicates that sh is used only if meta-chars are
found.

King Street Run?  Haven't been there for ages.  Any suggestions as to
other pubs for meets or are people happy with the Castle?  Punctuation's
great, even if they don't give you enough of it in the perl magnetic
poetry kits.

I wish to make a complaint. [Hmm. This isn't the right place][Nevermind]

The magnetic poetry kit (as sampled on Lucy's fridge) had no _ characters.
How can one write a perl program (particularly a perl6 program) with no _
characters?

Shocking, we're still on topic!

Can we play a round of "cam.transport"?
I'll start: "Buses are crap. You should use a bicycle!"


Of course, I don't actually read c.t, too busy for me.

If some of you are wondering why you sent mail and it didn't get there,
it's all mailman's fault. I haven't looked into the mailman side yet to
attempt to work out what screwed up, but mailman is definitely the
problem. Surprised? didn't think so.

Apologies,

MBM

Quite a lot, if the program is going to produce a lot of output.  The
number of times I've seen people do this:

$foo=`some command`;  # or array context if they have a tad more clue

@stuff = split(/\n/, $foo);

foreach (@stuff) {
}

is really scary.  The main problem with backticks is that your perl
script has to gather all the data before it can act on any of it.  This
(a) consumes lots of memory and (b) destroys any parallelism you might
be able to get out of the pipe.

Far nicer to do something like this:

use IO::File;

my $fh = new IO::File;

$fh->open("some command|") or die "Could not open pipe : $!\n";

while (<$fh>) {
}

$fh->close;

If you need to fire of several of these then you need to either fork
your perl process, or use select() to poll for which file handles have
data available to read.  See the perlipc man page for details (as has
been suggested elsewhere).

What's the most efficient way of determining whether a scalar contains an

I don't think you can do it from pure perl, (without going into some XS)
because any operation you try and do will do the cast. And what about things
with different parts in the IV and PV parts of the SV structure: think $!.

Those are both SvIOK and SvPOK I think.

  ^^^^^^^

probably a regexp. something like /^-?[1-9]\d*\z/

(note \z not $, as $ will let you have a trailing \n, which isn't part of
a number)

But the more question for a number is a classic mess. :-(

And maybe the above should be /^-?[1-9][0-9]*\z/ as Unicode or locales
may mean that \d matches a few other digit characters that maybe you
weren't expecting.

Delete the genetics. 

More seriously, take a look at somewhere like www.dabs.com - you want an
IDE disk, and IBM are probably best avoided at the moment. If speed
doesn't make much of a difference, just buy something cheap.

This works (and there's an equivalent for floating point numbers):

use POSIX;

$!=0;
($num, $unparsed) = &POSIX::strtol($str, 10);

if ($!) { print "Not an integer\n" };

This has a few advantages over regexps, such as the ability to specify
whether the scalar is a number in a particular base, while still
maintaining locale sensitivity.

I don't find this particularly useful for integers, but the floating
point equivalent is a lot less cumbersome than the regexp required for
floating point...

I don't know what Pete actually wanted, whether it was "what perl was
actually storing", or whether it was "is this a valid <foo>"

In fact, I was wrong, as I'm sure NWC spotted, you actually need an
SvIOKp(SV*) and SvPOKp(SV*) if you want perl to just tell you the
value of the flag, and not promote the SV* to the relevant subtype
based SV structure. This is in man perlguts around the
"What's Really Stored in an SV?" subheading for anyone who *actually*
cares.

Other than that, however, I think I find the above way neatest to determine
whether an SV* is an integer. Obviously anything in Perl can be cast to a
string. [1]

[1] By saying this, someone will jump out and show me a counter-example,
    but I can't think of one as I type this.

There should be a standard TLA (tricky lettered acronym) for this.
I've failed to put such a footnote on a couple of my recent posts, as
you've seen. 9-)


How about DTLACE?

Run doublespace! =8-)

But seriously, do you have any reason to believe that a new disk won't
immediately fill with more genetics?

Some of the Deskstars don't have known problems (he says, running a
machine with a IBM-DTLA-307030).

Also, if spare IDE slots and power consumption aren't a problem, buy
something smaller than the largest. Plotting size vs. price is tedious
but useful.

If speed is important then you have to look at seek times and disk
rpm. If it's very important then you need a real hardware geek, and
striping, and funky tricks like that.


Oh, and then you need somewhere to put the backups. *sigh*

Not possible, I'm afraid.  I could get rid of windoze instead.

I'm currently gzipping all the large things I'm not currently working on,
and crossing fingers that the next time I run something big it doesn't say
'device out of space'.

Backups?  What are they?  Seriously, I think I should probably keep an
offsite backup of the lab's data, cos no one else is going to.

but I've found the Castle far too crowded recently.

No, I didn't spot it. I wasn't looking too closely, and I'd already got
side tracked down the assumption that the question was
"is this a valid <foo>" which I'd tried to answer. And I already seem to
have far too much e-mail to read.

 Then wait for $DISASTER to happen then blackmail[1] them into doing

[1] No, of course I don't really mean blackmail. I mean threaten to

Not at all tedious, Dabs provide their whole price list in CSV format:

<http://www.dabs.com/stock.zip>

After that, it's a simple script to order by value for money. I have such,
but <whisper>it's written in Python</whisper> :-)

Current best value from Dabs is a Samsung SpinPoint V40 80GB UDMA100,
at just under 100 quid inc. VAT.

Scan do something similar, abit in HTML format - see

Its not too hard to parse tho; I do so as part of a hacked together
perl script which allows me to work out what hardware I'm looking to
buy next and how much its going to cost from various places. Currently
it supports online price checking from Dabs, Scan and Insight.

I've pondered releasing, however it is very much hacked together (ie its
a mess) and the only docs are comments in the code.

For consistency reasons, I hereby off-topically wibble about the length of
this signature. Someone has to do it, it appears, and it also appears
that David Damerell is absent.

Can you also prefix off-topic messages with [OT]?

Much more useful would be a blank perforated magnetic sheet and a
special cartridge for your inkjet printer. Then you can just push your
repository through some regexps and write your own poetry kit
according to frequency.

Presumably Thinkgeek could do a custom service if you sent them a text
file?

Most of the magnetic poetry stuff we've got at home have got a small amount of
blank magnetic sheet which you can write on and then cut up. AFAIR they also
provide you with a sheet of rub off transfers as well.

I'm surprised that the perl magnetic stuff doesn't do the same.

Sue, the small bouncy one, is heading back to her homeland of Australia in
a couple of weeks and I thought it might be nice to celebrate....er,
commiserate.  She will be gracing us with her presence at House on
Wednesday 24th April from....oooh, 7pm or whenever you get out of work.

Come along and be hugged!

Damn.  I've been told to make it 6ish.

Sue, the small bouncy one, is heading back to her homeland of Australia in
a couple of weeks and I thought it might be nice to celebrate....er,
commiserate.  She will be gracing us with her presence at House on
Wednesday 24th April from....oooh, 6pm or whenever you get out of work.

Come along and be hugged!

Goddamn insomnia.

Yes, me. It's _hard_ this month. I've got 40 on the Cantor, which I thought
was pretty good until I saw that Rick Klement has 34. On the Kokakola I have
a 73-character mess: BoB has 52.

please.

(BTW I shot 37 on Cantor, but on the Koca-Kola thing I can't do the
magic - there's this special case where you have "1" first which has to
be treated specially. Uses too many chars. Ho, hum).

Just a reminder that this month's social is tonight in the Castle Inn on
Castle Hill.  Look out for the camel.  I have some new book catalogues
from O'Reilly, if anyone's interested.

Also, prompted by a question from gnat on irc recently, what subject do
you think O'Reilly should tackle next?  And is anyone an expert on
clustering?

These aren't the clones you're looking for.

 Why, is it dangerous?

 Mmm. All I remember is that the O'Reilly Linux clustering book
was basically usless about a year and a half ago. It was like they'd
published it without finishing it properly first.

Prompted by previous discussion here, will we be looking for a new venue
for cam.pm? And given that I won't be there, someone let me know if
anything interesting happened there, please.

As Tony said - what sort of clustering?  Given that you're in
Bioinformatics, you may mean the sort of thing I'm doing at the Sanger
Institute.  I'm in the process, at the moment, of assembling a 768-node
Intel Linux cluster to add to the existing ~400 node Tru64-based Ensembl
compute farm.

Management software is key.  The existing Alphas really are separate
machines, so keeping them all in sync is pretty unpleasant, and involves
things last nasty expect scripts to drive the terminal servers.

More recent solutions like the Intel-based kit we're installing at the
moment are a breeze in comparison.

In this case, that's the kind of clustering I was interested in.  Sounds
groovy ;-)

The one you were referring to does indeed read the list. Some of the others
could get it as chiark.mail.perlmongers.cam. I disclaim all responsibility
for spreading the stories. :-)

No objections from this corner.

Pretty small, and has a tendency to be invaded by Magdalene rugby-types.
When do they stop serving food?

Good pub (other than the fact I'm now recognised by the landlord...)

Would work in summer, but probably not in winter. But it's almost
summer now, isn't it? (looks outside at grey sky and rain. Oh.)

All IMO, of course.

Since it's the beerfestival next weekend on Jesus Green, and I've agreed
to go and serve behind the bar on friday night and saturday...

I don't think I really need to say any more, do I? :-)

Friday evening, and look for the camel.

lol.  Unless MBM has his own personal camel (!), I take it this is a hint

10pm (unlike today), I shall be behind the bar at the beerfest later on

This is the Cam.Pm Beerfestival Obfuscated Perl Programming Contest.

The prize is that I will buy all the drinks for whoever I think should win
all night at the next meet that I make (which means that the winner should
also try and make the relevant meet :-)

The rules of the contest are fairly simple, below, I have drawn a beer glass
in `#' signs. Any of the hash signs must be filled by a non-whitespace
character, and no whitespace or null position must be filled by anything
other than a whitespace. The shebang line is not included in this, and is
not a necessary part of the submission. The contest is open from the moment
that this message goes out until midnight BST on June 2nd (ie. June 1st
23:59:59 is OK), and the challenge is to produce the most interesting
piece of code. It is open to everyone except Lucy and I, who will be
judging it, and the winner will be announced at the appropriate meeting.
Obviously, if you want to claim your prize, you will have to go to the
meeting. :-) (no cash equivalents etc). The image may not be shifted to
the left in any way, so if you want to rely on the spacing, it must be the
spacing below.

Submissions to oppc@cam.pm.org, and they will be confidential until the
winners are announced.

Despite the name, solutions do not have to be obfuscated, but the most
interesting will win the "prize". (and yes, I do intend to honour this.)

         This should read "All", my apologies.

If you want to use such things as large terminals or a specific version of
Perl, then please say in the submission (I will test it on both 5.005_03
and 5.6.1).

I'll be posting my own public (and non-judgeable submission soon, when I
get round to writing it). :-)

Damn - just caught up on reading my emails a bit. If I'd read this earlier I'd 
have gotten neko to thump you for me! MBM - please do it if you are still up 
there.

I suggest my local for some future cam.pm meet (well Lucy at least WAS 
planning to visit - dunno where she's staying now <-:)

Jarkko intends to have 5.8.0 RC1 out on the 1st June.
(At some point on the Saturday, where he's defining Saturday as GMT+5)

So you could test them on 5.8.0 RC1 too. (It's probably unfair to
judge them as fails if they don't work on it, but it would be interesting
to know if any don't)

This is not an entrant, but just to show that I think it's possible to do
something fun in that space, and with those constraints, this is my "entry"
for the scrutiny of the rest of the list. Constraints are that you will
need an ANSI-compliant terminal with at least 32 lines and 50 columns.
There is no constraint on the version of perl needed.

Web Development with Apache and Perl
By Theo Petersen

Greenwich, Connecticut, May 2002 -- Web Development with Apache and Perl
teaches web developers how to easily build a site with features like message
forums, chat, session management, custom preferences and other features.
More than a programming book, it covers a wide spectrum of practical issues
and how to handle them such as when to use a database, what information
needs to be secure (and how to secure it), and how to keep traffic from
crippling a website. It teaches the empowering use of ready-made modules so
developers do not have to reinvent the wheel. It even teaches how to
successfully advocate the use of Open Source tools in the corporate
environment.

What's Inside Web Development with Apache and Perl
* CGI and mod_perl programming
* mod_ssl, mod_rewrite and other Apache modules
* Using DBI with databases
* HTML::Mason and Template Toolkit for embedded scripting
* User login and session management
* Performance and system monitoring tools
* Growth planning and disaster recovery
* Sample layouts for community, corporate and e-commerce sites.

About the Author
A web developer committed to Open Source tools, Theo Petersen has spent many
years collecting experiences from other developers and evaluating web
development languages, add-ons and techniques to create a best-of-breed
toolkit for web applications. This book is the result. Theo lives in Denver,
Colorado.

I'm a bit of a lurker here, but I'd be keen to review the book.  It covers 
lots of stuff I'm involved in, including Mason and user authentication. 

Presumably we could publish a review on the web site?

it's very good, but has unfortunately missed its market.  If it had been

Just in case I'm in the middle of reinventing the wheel:

Has anyone written any modules to encapsulate and apply the information

If not, I'll press on.  Thanks.

I don't know of one. The only one I do know of is the Oxford one written
by Simon Cozens (who now works for OUCS), but obviously that's less useful
when in the Fenlands. :-)

Certainly I believe it to be something that more than one person would
benefit from, and I can't believe you're the first person to want to do
this. I'm quite happy to have it as a project on the website, or to link
to one of your choosing.

BTW, I've had 4 entries so far, keep them coming in, they've been really
good fun to analyse, and I have a nice long explanation email (and a web
page, that I'll make at the time I send the email) of how they work, and
what I thought of the techniques used. :-)

I seem to remember that the information there is not quite algorithmically
derived.  You may well get a better solution by hardcoding those numbers
into your module...

Indeed, my plan is to hardcode the non-algorithmic dates, by sucking them
off the web-page.  In fact, I've already done that bit 'cause it seemed 
like a fun way of playing with LWP and HTML::Parser.

I think a slightly better way of doing it would be to include something in
your Makefile.PL that generates the module's text in this way, and provides
it as data. This ensures that your module, when linked, is effectively
static, and doesn't require a Net connection, but also provides a nice way
to update it, and an easier way to keep it up-to-date when the format
changes.

My tuppence.

Ah, my fault for not explaining further.  That is exactly what I'm 
planning, and what I abbreviated into 'hardcode'.  A stand-alone script 
will generate the code for an internal submodule which is simply an object 
containing the dates.  The TermDates module won't need a net connection 
and won't need the weight of LWP and HTML::Parser.

Ah, yes, sorry, I didn't read it like that. That sounds very sensible.

Not necessarily, you could easily test for them in your build, and warn
and use a static file if they're not present.

Makefile.PL:
| #!/usr/bin/perl -w
| 
| use strict;
|
| my $html_parser=eval"use HTML::Parser;1";
| my $LWP=eval"use LWP;1";
| 
[...]
| my $got_file=0;
| if($html_parser && $LWP) {
[... go get the file and parse it ...]
[... build module from downloaded file ...]
|     $got_file=1
| }
| 
| if(!$got_file) {
|     warn "Using built-in defaults - errors are possible...\n";
[... build module from distributed file ...]
| }

That's what I'd do, in this situation, anyway.

This also has the advantage that you can look for programs like fetch(1)
(under BSD) or wget(1) and then try and use those too.

Hmm, true.  Since the web page currently provides dates to 2019-2020, I
was going to take the lazy option and provide the download script as an
bonus, possibly with a separate 'update' Makefile rule, and just include
the current version of the dates file with the module itself.

OK. Just a reminder, there are a little under 25 hours still to go of this,
I'm still interested in your solutions, and I have a nice analysis of the
ones I've received so far. I'll be posting a syntax highlit version on the
website too, so you can see how the people who have submitted have
constructed their impressive solutions.

Remember, an evening of free beer is at stake. :-)

This competition is now closed. We got the disappointing number of 4
entries. Obviously free beer is not a good enough motivator :-(.

The entries are:
* Jonathan Amery - Mandelbrot Set Generator
* Sebastian Bleasdale - Pong
* Dave Cantrell - Great Circle distance calculator
* Colin Watson - Star Wars "cam.pm" text

They all comply with the rules, and I'll be posting the winner (after
consultation with my co-judge), and my reformatted and commented versions
of the code. I also have an HTML version of this for the website, and
you'll be able to download all the code as a source tarball.

Please hold off posting the attached message to further fora

The funet URL is already valid if you want the real RC1.tgz,
or if you are following APC or the usual snapshot locations,
get the snapshot perl@16965, or rsync from the usual funet
snapshot location.

Have hopefully not too much fun.  I will be travelling and

=head1 Perl 5.8.0 Release Candidate 1

The Perl 5 developer team is pleased to announce the Release Candidate 1
of Perl 5.8.0.

Please test extensively.

Your help in testing the upcoming perl 5.8.0 is much appreciated.

This is a source code release, not a binary release.  You will need a
C development environment.

Please note that Perl 5.8.0 is a major new release of Perl containing
many new features, enhancements to existing features and bug fixes.
This version is "Release Candidate 1"; the purpose of this version is
to permit and encourage the Perl community to conduct extensive
testing and to report problems so that we, and the owners of affected
Perl packages, have an opportunity to correct them.

Because the process of testing the vast quantity of Perl software will
take time, and because issues uncovered by this testing may result in
further changes or corrections to Perl 5.8.0 and the various Perl packages,
WE DO NOT RECOMMEND USING RELEASE CANDIDATE 1 IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.

Please wait for the final version of Perl 5.8.0 for production use.
As always, you should conduct an appropriate level of testing before
using any new product in your production environment.

As specified in the licenses for Perl (see the files named Artistic
or Copying), THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

New Release Candidates will come out about weekly until we are
satisfied with the results, at which point the final 5.8.0 will
be released.

=head1 Where To Get It

The 5.8.0 RC1 is now available at

	http://mirrors.kernel.org/cpan/src/perl-5.8.0-RC1.tgz
	http://cpan.valueclick.com/src/perl-5.8.0-RC1.tgz
	ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/CPAN/src/perl-5.8.0-RC1.tgz
	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/CPAN/src/perl-5.8.0-RC1.tgz

and as the CPAN mirrors catch up, in the src/ subdirectory of
your nearest friendly CPAN mirror.

The size of the file is 10913451 bytes and the MD5 checksum for the file is

        f595a07df28eb9e40d4d27281a9b37a9  perl-5.8.0-RC1.tgz
 
This release should work in all UNIX/Linux and Microsoft environments,
and in other environments which have POSIX/UNIX interfaces, such as
BeOS, Cygwin, MPE/iX, NetWare, OS/2, QNX, VMS, VOS, and z/OS,
and the appropriate C compilation environment.

A MacOS Classic port requires a little bit more work but it should
become available soon-- follow http://dev.macperl.org/

=head1 Why To Get It

For the list of changes in 5.8.0 see the pod/perldelta.pod, available
separately online at

	http://mirrors.kernel.org/cpan/doc/perldelta.pod
	http://cpan.valuelick.com/doc/perldelta.pod
	ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/CPAN/doc/perldelta.pod
	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/CPAN/doc/perldelta.pod

(and again, eventually at all CPAN mirrors-- note, though, that these
URLs are not permanent, they will be removed when the final 5.8.0 is
released)

The .tgz file will unpack into a directory called "perl-5.8.0-RC1".

=head1 How To Do It

You will configure, build, and test Perl.  Below is a short summary,
for the full story read the "INSTALL" file.

=head2 Configuring

If you are in a UNIX-like system, you can setup Perl for compilation
by changing into the "perl-5.8.0-RC1" directory and issuing the
following command:

	sh Configure -des

This will simply select all the defaults for your system, INCLUDING
defaulting to install in the usual location for production software.
(So don't run make install if you run Configure this way!)

If you are not in a UNIX-like system (say, Win32), please read the
"INSTALL" file and any possible platform specific README files for
further instructions, and skip the parts below that don't apply to
your platform.

If you want to go through Configure interactively (for example
to change the default installation directories), do just

	sh Configure

=head2 Building

To build Perl issue the command

	make all

Note that the build times can vary considerably.  Perl 5.8.0 is about
twice the size of 5.6.1, and some source code files are quite large,
so your compiler might have hard time processing them.  On a fast
modern system with lots of CPU and memory the build can be a matter of
ten minutes, but on slower/older/more heavily loaded systems it can
take up to eight hours, while half an hour to an hour being common.

=head2 Testing

After the build has finished, it's time to test the build.

	make test

Again, testing times vary a lot.  Perl 5.8.0 has more than five times
the tests of Perl 5.6.1.  Fifteen minutes to half an hour is quite
normal, but a slow system may easily take an hour or more.  If all
tests are successful, "make test" will say "All tests successful"
(unsurprisingly).

If all tests are not successful, you may get a more detailed report
by changing to the t/ subdirectory and running the "harness" script,
something like this

	cd t
	./perl harness

You may need to set up your dynamic library path before that
(the final message of "make test" should tell all the needed details).

The more detailed report will be very useful when your report problems.
Knowing your exact configuration is essential, too: usually running the
"myconfig" script from the build directory produces this information.

Note that some systems or configurations have known problems,
see perldelta for details, no need to report them.

In case you still see errors, please document them via the perlbug
system, as detailed in the "INSTALL" file, section "Reporting Problems".

Finally note that if you happen to have a "less common" platform, like
some of the rarer UNIXes, or something even more exotic, we will be
glad to hear even of successes, not just about possible problems.

=head2 Installing

Once you are happy with the test results of Perl itself (or you are
just feeling extraordinarily brave), you may consider installing it.

The Perl development team has tried to guarantee that popular Perl
applications like CGI, LWP, mod_perl and DBI/DBD work with 5.8.0.
Note "work", not necessarily "work without warnings": for example
DBD::Oracle works, but during compilation and testing you may see
various warnings.  Also in some cases not all the functionality of
the modules may be available (yet).

However...

THIS IS A REAL NEW PERL RELEASE THAT IS BINARY INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANY
PREVIOUS PERL RELEASE.  THIS MEANS THAT YOUR OLD EXTENSIONS (.xs code,
those Perl modules requiring a C compiler) WILL NOT WORK AND WILL HAVE
TO BE RECOMPILED.  (Pure Perl modules should continue working.)

INSTALLING THIS PERL RELEASE WILL OVERWRITE YOUR CURRENT PERL RELEASE.
(For example, /usr/bin/perl will become Perl 5.8.0.)

DO NOT INSTALL THIS INTO PRODUCTION USE UNLESS YOU REALLY MEAN IT.

If you still feel like installing this, you can do so by "make install".

If you want to install this, but want to install it into some less
dangerous place (and not overwrite your current installation),
do the following

	make clean
	sh Configure -des -Dprefix=/test/perl580 -Uinstallusrbinperl
	make all
	make test

and then the "make install".  The -Dprefix will place the Perl
installation at the said directory (the Perl executable will be
/test/perl580/bin/perl), and the -Uinstallusrbinperl will avoid
overwriting /usr/bin/perl with a copy of the Perl 5.8.0 executable.

=head1 Testing The Perl Installation

You should test both your own code, and other code that you use.

=head2 Testing Your Own Code

Test your own code with perl 5.8.0, but in case of surprises read the
perldelta.pod carefully before judging something as a bug.  In some
cases the behaviour of Perl has changed.

=head2 Testing Perl Modules

You should try reinstalling your favourite CPAN modules to guarantee
that they will continue working under Perl 5.8.

Note that if you find some module either failing its tests or you see
the tests emitting warning messages, please first and foremost report
these problems to the author of the module.  Advise him/her about the
impending 5.8.0 release and where to get the RC1 (you might for example
point the author to this very message).  Since there are hundreds of
modules available, the Perl 5 developer team is not qualified to be
experts on all of them; it is much faster if the module author resolves
any problems.

In some cases you may also consider contacting some mailing lists
to ask for help (and to spread awareness of the upcoming 5.8.0),
for example if your operating system or the modules have mailing
lists of their own.

=head2

That's it.

This is similar to the one on the website, but is less unedited and has
more of my personal views of what I thought of the entries.

In the reformattings that I've posted below, I've kept variable and function
names the same, but I've squashed the '"."' and reformatted with spaces to
make subroutines more readable.

In the order in which I got them, I'll start off with an analysis of mine:

    For those that didn't try it, it prints the same pint glass, full, and
    empties it at a rate of one line per second. At the end it prints
    "Drink Beer, Program Perl, Cam.pm". The way it works is pretty simple,
    the shape of the glass is encoded in the scalar $e, in groups of 4
    bytes. The first byte in each group is the number of lines, then the
    number of spaces, then the number of hashes, and the number of spaces
    to the midline of the glass. The function g() prints out the glass,
    using this data, and also prints `@' in the bottom $l lines of the
    glass. r() reads the top hex digit on the encoding, modifying it as
    it goes. The end is just a simple rot13 and substitute. The comments
    are, of course, just regexp matches in null context. This trick is
    thanks to BooK in his Postscript and Perl TPJ entry.

    Rewritten, it looks something like:
------------------------------8<------------------------------
sub r {
    $d=~s/^(..)//;
    return(hex$1)
}

$e="020A1000
    0209020F

    040C020C
    040D020B
    020E020A
    020E0C00";

$e=~s/\s+//g;

sub g {
    $l=shift;
    $d=$e;
    while(length($d)) {
	($n,$s1,$h,$s2)=(r,r,r,r);
	for(1..$n) {
	    $s++;
	    $a=(31-$l)>$s?chr(32):"@";
	    print(chr(32)x$s1,"#"x$h,${a}x($s2*2),"#"x$h,"\n")
	}
    }
}

print"\e[2J";

for$t((reverse(2..28))) {
    $s=0;
    sleep(1);
    print"\e[0;0H";
    g($t);
}

$_="Qevax*Orre,*Cebtenz*Crey,*Pnz.cz\n";

    Dave commented in his submission that he didn't think it was "that
    obfuscated" and I'm inclined to agree. In order to understand the
    format for entry I needed to de-obfuscate it, certainly. Dave's
    approach, however, to the problem of whitespace was interesting,
    and certainly one I was expecting to see more. Basically, he put
    most of his code into a scalar ($foo) and then applied some
    substitutions on it, first to get rid of the space, and then to
    turn `&' into a tab (the reason he chose tab is obvious in this
    case, but it would have been possible to have the last line as
    being ``foo=~y/&/\040/;eval$foo;'' and that would have been just
    as correct. In order to run it you supply two coordinates in
    degree minutes and seconds (eg. 51:31:47N,00:02:54W) on the
    command line. I'm slightly surprised that Dave didn't make more
    use of the $spc variable at the beginning, but on the whole, the
    program is pretty self-explanatory. Amazingly, Dave doesn't seem
    to have needed comments at all.

    I loved this entry, it took me a while to figure out what Sebi had
    done, but having worked it out didn't make me any less impressed.
    In order to run it, I used
        stty cbreak -echo; perl entry1.pl; stty sane
    A couple of negative marks go for the fact that it couldn't set
    that itself, and Sebi did send me a version which didn't quite
    conform to the rules which manged to do it. In particular, I
    liked the use of the middle spaces to draw the playing area. Sebi
    was one of the few people who managed to really use those spaces,
    rather than having to work around them. I think my commented version
    below probably explains best how it works, though.

    I liked this one too. I especially like the way it tries to fit the set
    into the terminal. Jon had lots of space for comments, and there are
    some nice ones like the ``# :)'' comment. Unlike Sebi, Dave or me, he
    worked round the space, rather than either using it, or just quoting it
    and then removing it, and I, personally, liked the use of the /x
    modifier on the regexp. I liked the use of the colour code array and
    using the size of that array to determine how many iterations to go
    before giving up. Jon's use of "\040" for " " was nice, too. Personally,
    I suspect that I would have used a map against the colour array, and
    built it in a more interesting way, say:
        @st=map{"$si$_m"}(1..7),map{"$sij$_m"}(0..7);
    but Jon's way is totally reasonable. As it was, he was left with a lot
    of space to use. Given that he's a mathematician, I'm surprised that
    he used $c rather than $i for the "imaginary part" of the complex
    number, but the algorithm is pretty simple. I have to admit to not
    being entirely sure about the press return to exit thing, but I guess
    that is so that you can see the whole screenful of set before quitting.

    This one took me a while to figure out, because I'm not that up on
    the maths for the vector graphics. In effect, this works by many
    different variables having the various scaling factors. Colin, like
    some of the others, used a data stream which ignored spaces. This
    got him right into the beer area of the glass, bypassing a lot of the
    problems that the whitespace throws up. Colin used a number of tricks
    that we haven't seen in other entries, the use of the --$| trick for
    getting alternate lines. He looked at a completely different way of
    encoding the space. Rather than chr(32) or "\040", Colin went for an
    out-of-the-box approach ``(B^b)''. He offered to provide his own
    commented version, but I'll put the one that I've produced below, and
    I'll leave it to him to publish his to the list. In mine, I've
    actually added and removed a few brackets, in the interests of
    clarity. Though I did like the ``(next)if<condition>'' trick that
    Colin used to get round the whitespace restrictions.

Free beer always good, at least from my point of view... lack of free
time, OTOH :-(

What I played with for a while (without getting very far) was trying to
get a quine out of this... any takers? All the whitespace just tied me
up in knots...

 Historical reasons.  I learned about Mandelbrot sets long before I

 Originally I just subtracted a line from the size of the terminal,
but I use a two-line prompt which reminded me that other people's
setups might do even wierder stuff to the display.

Did you notice the little cheats though?  $foo=~s/\s//gi has a completely
pointless /i where I needed an extra character, and there are a couple of
places where I put blah=&subroutinecall where the & later gets turned
into a pointless tab.

And the next Cam.pm obfuscated programming contest is....(drum
roll)...my homework.  Only kidding.  This is a simple problem which has
been giving me a headache for a while.

I have a (large!) file containing pairwise scores for a number of genes.
Whereas the example below shows 3 genes, in real life there are thousands of
genes, hence I keep running out of memory.

Gene1	Gene2	Score
Alice	Alice	1
Alice	Bob	0.8
Alice	Carl	0.9
Bob	Bob	1
Bob	Carl	0.2
Carl	Carl	1


For each gene, I want to rank all other genes depending on their pairwise
scores:

Alice:	1st = Carl (0.9)	2nd = Bob (0.8)
Bob:	1st = Alice (0.8)	2nd = Carl (0.2)
Carl:	1st = Alice (0.9)	2nd = Bob (0.2)


Thus outputting a list of genes pairs, scores and ranks to a file:

Gene1   Gene1   Score	Rank1	Rank2
Alice	Alice	1	n/a	n/a
Alice   Bob	0.8	2	1
Alice   Carl	0.9	1	1
Bob	Bob	1	n/a	n/a
Bob	Carl	0.2	2	2
Carl	Carl	1	n/a	n/a

where:
Rank1 = rank of gene2 in list for gene1
Rank2 = rank of gene1 in list for gene2


Soooo. I've tried putting it all in a hash, but there's too much data.
My current mediocre approach is to go throught the file once for each gene
and print to n intermediary files (where n is total number of genes), which
frankly takes far too long.  Shall swap beer for useful ideas.

It depends on the data, but I'd try the following:

1. Just throw everything into a database and 

	SELECT MAX(score) FROM scores GROUP BY geneA, geneB;

   or somesuch.

2. If the distribution of genes isn't very correlated then make a hash 
   from gene name to number and store the best score in

	$best[$h{$gene_a} + $stride * $h{$gene_b}]

   where $stride is larger than the number of genes. There might be a
   speed win if you preset the size of @best to $stride ^ 2. If that
   still takes too much memory then you might be able to use PDL to
   store the array more compactly. I think PDL packs things pretty
   densely so if you've got N genes and store the score in a four byte
   float the working size should be about 4 N^2 bytes. In perl I think 
   a factor of ten is the usual one, so I'd expect a footprint of
   about 40 N^2 bytes.

3. If PDL is too slow, parse the data with perl then do the max() with
   C or something, either writing a separate program or use Inline ?

Obviously if the order of the genes isn't important then you can halve
the memory usage by only storing half the array.

Cheers,

Use Sleepycat libdb? 
http://search.cpan.org/search?module=BerkeleyDB

This should be able to handle hashes bigger than RAM size. If not,
it's broken. The libdb C API certainly allows it.

Alternatively, sort your file by gene1, and keep a hash of offsets into
the file by gene1. When looking for a (gene1,gene2,score) tuple, jump
to the appropriate place in the file for gene1, and do a sequential scan
from that point. The OS buffer cache should help.

Tie the hash to a nice dbm file.

Hmmm, interesting. I almost like it. I'm worried about its effect on Perl

So I look ahead in my diary and spy this month's social is nigh, on

Oh.  Any time from 7.  Hopefully, all the footie spectators will be
too tired from getting up at 7am to crowd the pubs.  And I shall bring
along the Web Dev book for someone to review.  Hmm, why did that last
message take 24 hours to be delivered?

I was hoping to pop in, but I'm struggling to get over a cold, and won't 
be coming out to play.

If no-one else claims the Web Dev book, I'll arrange to get it from you 
somehow else.

Well, first version is available as an Aunt Sally.  It should probably be 
considered alpha, since the name and API may change, depending on the 
comments I receive.

Alpha-testers and critics welcome (I think!)

I'm in the mood to be sociable this week.  Anyone fancy a trip to the
pub/cinema?  Actually, beer will probably be involved, so it's not that
offtopic.

"Richard Stallman is outside in a backhoe with LART written on the
side". [Can't be JFRd to find the User Friendly URL for that one]

On the bright side, you can be reasonably sure of decent quality beer
if you pick the pub carefully. 8-)


But seriously, I'll go if it's after Wednesday (19th). Hmm, that's not
very helpful is it?

Well I can't find the UF edition I was thinking of. Maybe it was the
one linked from free-sklyarov-uk a while back?

  http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20020428

Nope. Ah, after a _lot_ of catching up (backwards) on back issues,

  http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20010506


Oh, and why? The comment about Hollywood, half way through

Incidentally, is "ontopic" morphologically related to "ectopic"?

I don't know if there are any FreeBSD users on this list, but I
know there are people who like a drink, so I thought there might
be some interest...

Kris Kennaway is in Cambridge in July for a conference on string theory,
which is more than enough of an excuse for a pub meet (perhaps with other
entertainments as well -- punting has been suggested). Kris's conference
finishes on the 20th which will therefore be the date for the meet. In
order for me to select a venue etc. would those who are interested please
email me, saying if they are also interested in punting.

uname -a
FreeBSD colon.colondot.net 4.6-STABLE FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE #10: Sat Jun 29 01:33:36 BST 2002     root@colon.colondot.net:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/COLONDOT  i386

Well, the list runs on a FreeBSD box, so I guess that makes the list a
FreeBSD user :-)

(I think that there may be a few more lurking...)

Umm... my very favourite was Pom::PomObject, which was written by a
colleague at Incyte.  He wanted to open source it, but AFAIK, nothing
came of that, sadly.  It was a template for object classes which could
dump themselves as XML, and recreate themselves from XML. Nothing that
remarkable in that, Boulder::IO does something similar, but this was
very fast and had the added advantage that it could dump its own DTD,
and the XML was valid against that DTD, not just well-formed a la
Boulder::IO.

For sheer perversity I really like DBI::Chart.  Whoever was twisted
enough to realise that SQL actually makes quite a natural language for
describing charts really deserves some sort of medal.  What really
amazed me about it when I tried it was that it really works, and allows
you to draw really nice graphs, particularly from other DBI objects
connected to real databases, with extremely concise and clear code.

I'm also quite keen on tied objects as a means of hiding nasty
implementation details, or as means through tied dbm files of reducing a
script's memory usage.  Quite useful in my field.  Here be dragons
though - some DBMs seem to be really bad about creating vast sparse
files.  We just found one at work today.  The .pag and .dir files were
0.5 TB and 0.8 TB in 'size' (not sure which way round) and contained a
mere 40K and 67 MB of real data respectively.  We discovered this when
trying to move the data onto new storage, and rsync filled the target
RAID array completely.  Beware of rsync and sparse files!!!  I've never
had that problem with tied hashes and GDBM files though...

Just a quick reminder, this is tomorrow, (or maybe today for those of you
who read your email on Friday morning).

Hopefully I'll be able to make it, if not, there will be others there.

It would be nice to see some of the lurkers :-), as well as, of course,
all the regular attendees.

Hope to see you there.

A reminder that I have 'Web Development with Apache and Perl' to give away

People seem to turn up anytime from 7-9.  I'll be there from about 7, with
a small camel.

As an active Perl/mod_perl/apache developer (who just happens to lurk on this list because it's one of the few in England), I'd be more than happy to oblige :-) [this is the Theo Peterson book, right?]

Do you want me to mail you off list with my particulars?

Regards,

Phil.

In case you've not read use.perl, slashdot, the london.pm list or anything
else carrying the news, Perl 5.8.0 is out.

It has now escaped to various CPAN mirrors (although not ftp.demon.net last
time I checked.)

However, the fine folks at flirble.org have it on their mirror (located in
Soho, and well connected), accessible via both http and ftp:

    http://cpan.m.flirble.org/src/perl-5.8.0.tar.gz
    ftp://cpan.m.flirble.org/pub/lang/perl/CPAN/src/perl-5.8.0.tar.gz

You can use IPv6 to get it, or IPv4 if you really must. :-)

$ host -t aaaa cpan.m.flirble.org
cpan.m.flirble.org      CNAME   philes.flirble.org
philes.flirble.org      AAAA    2001:6F8:604:0:0:0:0:1
$ host cpan.m.flirble.org
cpan.m.flirble.org      CNAME   philes.flirble.org
philes.flirble.org      A       194.70.3.50

The release announcement is at http://dev.perl.org/perl5/ in English, Chinese
(both simplified and traditional) Japanese and Korean.

    There was the faint sound of footsteps.
    "Chap with a whip got as far as the big sharp spikes last week,"
    said the low priest.
    There was a sound like the flushing of a very old dry lavatory.
    The footsteps stopped.  The High Priest smiled to himself.
    "Right," he said.  "See your two pebbles and raise you two pebbles."
    The low priest threw down his cards.  "Double Onion," he said.
    The High Priest looked down suspiciously.
    The low priest consulted a scrap of paper.  "That's three hundred
    thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four pebbles you owe me," he said.
    There was the sound of footsteps.  The priests exchanged glances.
    "Haven't had one for poisoned-dart alley for quite some time,"
    said the High Priest.
    "Five says he makes it", said the low priest.  "You're on."
    There was a faint clatter of metal points on stone.
    "It's a shame to take your pebbles."
    There were footsteps again.
    -- Terry Pratchett, "Reaper Man"

This is the Perl 5.8.0.

The official announcement (for use.perl.org, for dev.perl.org/perl5,
comp.lang.perl.announce, etc.) will go out soon as enough mirrors
have picked up the tar.gz.  I'll ask the mirror sites to expedite
their mirrors.  (Yes, please, don't use.perl this yet.)

If your CPAN does not have it yet, you can pick up the release as the
snapshot 17638: ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/snap/perl@17638.tgz
(note that this, as snapshots do, unpacks as directory perl/,
not as perl-5.8.0/)

As discussed, the plan is to have a Perl 5.8.1, but not before Perl
5.9.0.  I'll take some time off from p5p, to cool down my "Thanks,
applied" reflexes, and to have a life, but most importantly, to let
Hugo to grab the helm.

My thanks go to:

- Hugo van der Sanden for lacking enough self preservation
  instincts to refuse the Perl 5.9 pumpkinship
  (The pumpking is dead! Long live the pumpking!)

- perl5-porters without whom no Perl release would ever be done

- Perl users on non-mainstream platforms who helped to get Perl
  running from the tiniest PDAs to the most hulking big iron

- Nokia Research Center, Helsinki University of Technology
  Computing Center, and Center for Scientific Computing and FUNET
  for giving me resources to develop and maintain Perl

and last but foremost, my lovely wife Elaine will hopefully be glad to
have me back after two years of virtual widowhood.

Careful, in Cambridge all criticism of Debian is (rightly, IMO) out of
order.

Anyway, should a semantic error like this (on Debian woody's perl) really
give me a SEGV? Is there a good reason why the parser can't say "Error,
you have transfunged the first two arguments?"

"Debian is perfect. there is no way to improve Debian" :-)
(Don't) discuss. (as you're just said that you're not allowed to criticise,
therefore you can only agree).

$ perl5.6.1 -e 'read( $x, X, 10 )'
Segmentation fault
$ perl5.8.0 -e 'read( $x, X, 10 )'

It would appear to be known and fixed in 5.8.0. :-)

(SEGVing 5.8.0 can be done, but not in many of the ways that 5.6.1 can be
SEGVed)

Indeed. Any software that works is "obsolete", anyway.

It can, you just have to ask it to :)

pan:~$ perl -w -e 'use strict; read( $x, X, 10 )'
Global symbol "$x" requires explicit package name at -e line 1.
Bareword "X" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at -e line 1.
Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.

Presumably it SEGVs in your case because it regards filehandles as just a
funny kind of scalar, and tries to write into the memory referenced by it.
I thought it might be converting the bareword X into a string, but I don't
think that's what's happening.

That seems very bad.

on 5.005_03, I get:
| [mbm@mallard]:~$ perl -we 'read($x,X,10)'
| Can't modify constant item in read at -e line 1, at end of line
| Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.
on 5.6.0 (linux SuSE?):
| mbm@well:~ > perl -we 'read($x,X,10)'
| Can't modify constant item in read at -e line 1, at end of line
| Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.
and on 5.6.1, a debian build:
| [mbm@potato]:~$ perl -we 'read($x,X,10)'
| Segmentation fault
5.6.1, built for FreeBSD:
| [mbm@colon]:~/tmp/perl-5.6.1$ ./perl -we 'read($x,X,10)'
| Name "main::X" used only once: possible typo at -e line 1.
| Name "main::x" used only once: possible typo at -e line 1.

Nick, care to clarify this? should this be one of the tests ?

It is. All SEGVs are very bad and should not happen.
Although SEGVs due to stack exhaustion caused by very large amounts of
recursion in the regexp engine are very hard not to prevent.

5.6.0 seems very bad full stop. (Well, that's my opinion)

> Nick, care to clarify this? should this be one of the tests ?

5.6.1 (and presumably 5.6.0) seems to have a lot of SEGV bugs which all seem
to be variants of doing something naughty with barewords. I believe all the
know (ie reported or discovered by p5p) ones are fixed in 5.8.0.

Cool. Sounds like this one I found when I typoed a bareword instead of a
glob:

  $ perl -e 'sub TIEHANDLE { print "tied!\n"; } tie STDERR, "main";'

As in your case, 5.8 has fixed this.

I didn't think that Aussies knew what badgers were. They have their entire
own set of fauna.

Perhaps it should be:
``Everybody (except Australians) knows that badgers like mashed potato.''

Well, Australians certainly don't pronounce router correctly, so a while
back an educational self-help guide was made:

http://badgersandfish.com/router/

(I gather they claim this failure to pronounce correctly is due to some
or other rather rude slang term. Some excuse!)

Oh, apparently not.[0]  They don't know what they're missing.  It seems
the Gryffindor Quidditch captain has a badger fetish.[1]

Damian will be talking in London at the end of August, but they're still
faffing over details.  Shall keep you notified.

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Damian Conway, speaking at the Conway Hall

Damian Conway will be coming to London in August, and thanks to his
offer to talk to us, the efforts of a group of people who have made
donations to book a venue, and Richard Clamp who has gone to the venue to
book it, we now have a firm date and place for the meeting.

Damian will be speaking at the Conway Hall, Holborn on the evenings of
Tuesday 27th August and Thursday 29th August. So far the topic is not
fixed, but it seems likely one night will tackle Perl 6 and another will
be one of his talks on Perl 5, chosen from this list:

http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Extreme.html
http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Life.html
http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Perligata.html
http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Sky.html

If you have strong feelings about which talk you'd like to see, please
contact me off list, or talk to me at one of the forthcoming social
meetings.

Damian's Perl 6 talk is described here:

http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Perl6.html

The Conway Hall on Red Lion Square, near Holborn tube station, on the
Piccadilly and Central lines.

http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=530648&Y=181767&A=Y&Z=1

The time of the meetings has not yet been fixed, but it makes sense to aim
for as early as possible. (The venue closes at 9.45pm.) Again, if you have
strong feelings about whether or not you can make it to a meeting for
either
6pm, 6.30pm or 7pm, please contact me off list.

If you're in contact with other user groups who may be interested in seeing
one of the more renowned speakers in the Perl world, please feel free to
forward this mail, or be prepared to do so once we firm up starting times
(and get a page on the web site describing the meeting :).

Thanks,

you really feel the need to post it to other groups, feel free to work
it into my post to announce.

go to list or can be addressed to me personally.

Happy now? ;-), Leon

I note on http://cam.pm.org/meets_when.shtml :

"Future meets [...]:

 * Wednesday 2002-08-14"

This leaves two questions:

* Who's going to be there?
* Where is "there" anyway? Maypole again?

I don't much like the Maypole -- neither the drinks nor the food is very good.
I suggest the Castle.

Hi there, I'm having a problem with a type of file I deal with... here's the
story...

file example
##########################################################
score   start  end  identifier
9e-63    285    1001 ENSP00000218091
3e-58    293    996  ENSP00000218091
1e-57    280    1003 ENSP00000218091
1e-42    280    1003 ENSP00000218091
1e-42    280    1003 ENSP00000218092
1e-42    284    1004 ENSP00000218092
##########################################################

code:
##########################################################
while (<IN>){
  @array = ();
  if(/^\d/){
    chomp $_;
    @fields = split(/\s+/,$_);
    if ($fields[3] =~ /ENSP/ && $fields[0] < 0.0005){
     push (@array, $fields[0],
              $fields[1],
              $fields[2],
              $fields[3],);
    $match = $fields[8];
    push (@{$hash{$match}}, [@array]);
    }#end if
  }#end if
close (IN);

############################################################
This gives me a hash with each identifier as a new key.  In each value for
the key is an array of arrays.  In this case, there are 2 array, one holding
4 array (of the values in the file fields) for all rows that match
ENSP00000218091, the other holding 2 arrays for matches to ENSP00000218092.

I'm trying to sort firstly by identifier.  This works with:

############
code:

foreach $match (sort keys %hash){
 print "\n\n$match: ", scalar(@{$hash{$match}}), "hits.";
}#end foreach.

######################

But I'm trying to sort by firstly identifier, and then start position.  I
used the following code, but it doesn't seem to work.  Can anyone help me?

######################

foreach (sort {@{$hash{$match}}->[$b]->[1] <=> @{$hash{$match}}->[$a]->[1]}
keys %hash){
  print "\n$match: ", scalar(@{$hash{$match}}), "hits.";
}#end foreach

###########################

Is it possible to use the 'or' operator to fit both of these into one
command?
Thanks

From the data you gave, $fields[8] is not defined. Should this be
$fields[3]?

Why not just do ' push (@{$hash{$match}}, [@fields]); '?

You're missing a close brace, I presueme here.

Yes. 'use strict;' is your friend :-)

The instant problem with the above is that $match is not defined when you
do your sort comparision; after that, it all gets a bit bizarre.

Try something like:

--- cut here ---
foreach my $match ( keys %hash ) {

    my @entries = @{ $hash{$match} };

    foreach my $data ( sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] } @entries ) {
	print "$match $data->[1]\n";
    }

}
--- cut here ---

> Is it possible to use the 'or' operator to fit both of these into one

I'm not sure quite why you're trying to combine all this into one
command; that way tends to lend to highly unreadable Perl...

Hope this helps -- please feel free to ask any further questions!

[story snipped]

As Phillip pointed out, use strict; is your friend as it catches a lot of 
typos and thinko's.

Here's my solution to the problem. My assumption is that, in the second 
part, you want to produce answers sorted by id, then start position with a 
total for that combination.

#! /usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my @data = ();
my %ids = ();
my %idpos = ();

while (<DATA>) {

    # use next rather than if for controlling execution in
    # while, for & foreach loops, less braces to trip you up :)
    next unless /^\d/; 
    chomp;
    my ($score, $start, $end, $id) = split /\s+/;

    next unless ( $id =~ /ENSP/ && $score < 0.0005 );

    # push an anonymous hashref onto the data array
    push @data, { score => $score,
                  start => $start,
                  end   => $end,
                  id    => $id
                };

    # increment total per id counter
    $ids{$id}++;

1e-57    280    1003 ENSP00000218091
1e-42    280    1003 ENSP00000218091
1e-42    280    1003 ENSP00000218092
1e-42    284    1004 ENSP00000218092

Note - the alternative is really just an example of sorting the array of 
hashes we made in the first part of the code. It is actually quite a lot 
slower than doing the count during the data parsing phase.

If you were unable to count during the parsing phase, maybe you need to do 
it several times with very large data sets and can't hold that many sets 
in memory, you would be marginaly better off to repeat the foreach loop 
to setup %idpos.

Running the three approaches through Benchmark gives:

Benchmark: timing 50000 iterations of Early Count, Late Count, Mid Count..
              Rate  Late Count   Mid Count Early Count
Late Count  1067/s          --        -11%        -30%
Mid Count   1205/s         13%          --        -21%
Early Count 1527/s         43%         27%          --

Where Early Count is counting during parsing, Mid Count repeats the 
foreach loop to set up %idpos and Late Count does the maths on the fly as 
per the alternate solution.

Well, I've waffled on for long enough. I hope that helped somehow.

Data Munging with Perl is very good for this kind of thing (and Dave 
didn't pay me to say so either :).

This looks suspiciously like bioinformatics ;)  Richard, can I be nosy and
ask what you do, seeing as the www.mrc-dunn.cam.ac.uk appears not to be
working.

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Damian reminders, tech meet chivvy

Just a quick reminder of the special meetings next week (that's Tuesday
27th and Thursday 29th) at London's Conway Hall, where Damian Conway
(and, on Tuesday, Hugo van der Sanden) will be speaking to us about the
future of Perl 5, the future of Perl 6, and Life, the Universe and
Everything.

There'll be reminders on the main list on Monday and Wednesday, too. I
see that my earlier request for the meeting to be well-publicised seems
to have worked (thanks everyone) so it could be busy. The Conway Hall
opens at 6pm and talks will begin at 6.30.

Full details of the venue and talks are on the London.pm website:
http://london.pm.org/meetings/

The next social meeting will be on Thursday 5th September, at a venue
to be confirmed, quite probably the Calthorpe Arms. The venue will be
confirmed by the second of Damian's talks, though.

The next technical meeting will be on Thursday 12th September, a week
earlier than usual because of YAPC::Europe. I'm still looking for
speakers, venues and (most hopefully) a volunteer to do all of the
tricky organising stuff for me.

Thanks,

yeah, thanks everyone, I got it working in the end.....

To reply to Lucy's question, I sure am doing bioinformatics.  At the moment
I'm just trying to map a whole load of human sequences from blast results
onto a database of yeast proteins, but the blast data is filled with lots of
'semi' redundancy (eg. hit1 = ENSP00000012345 from 201-498; hit2 =
ENSP0000012345 from 204-490).  So I'm just trying to remove them.  It's
going to help with both my research, which is on protein protein
interactions, and also with anyone else who uses the blast program we have
here.....

Thanks again for all your help

Richard

Richard,

Is your TARDIS broken? A couple of days ago you posted from August 2001, and

Right, I was waiting for this. I will probably try and take Tuesday
off work, then, so I can stay over. I suspect the normal place would be
the Castle Inn, Castle Street, but I can't remember what the general
consensus was...

We certainly moved the last meet back to the Castle due to deciding the

Given the the monthly social is currently scheduled for Friday 13th, I
suggest a rearrangement to Monday 9th.

Shame, I was looking forward to the chance to chat to you a bit since I
had to dash off after your talk at the Sanger Institute this afternoon
(which I enjoyed a lot - thanks very much!)

What was the talk?  We had fun anyway.  Quotes of the night were...<tries

"So I had an interesting time at the Brazilian Consulate on Friday..."
"It's not en croute, more croute on the side."

and the hilarious

"I'm deprived."


I thank you...

Hmmm, these seemed much funnier last night than in the cold light of day.

Well, not much funnier. Slightly funnier, perhaps.

A synopsis of what Parrot is, why it exists, what its aims are, and what
the plans for it in the future are.  That sort of thing.  Very much a
non-technical overview.  We were, after all, a bunch of
bioinformaticians, almost universally without any formal CS training, so
we don't have much of a clue as to what a "continuation" is, for
example - lisp not spoken here!

The nice autumn ale probably helped.  I heard some intriguing beer gossip
last night, which might possibly involve the Castle and Milton
brewery. </cryptic>

Most computer scientists don't understand continuations either :-)
And they aren't really a Lisp thing (although they probably found
their way into Lisp), more a Scheme thing. And a bit of ML too.

Tony (who found a bug in some hairy continuation-passing code in the
Concurrent ML book).

I came across this on openchallenge.org and it set me wondering.

"The challenge consists of writing coding guidelines for experienced
programmers wishing to adopt Perl. These guidelines are not intended for
"Perl hackers", but for the  ones who are most used to programming in C or
other not-so-idiomatic languages. Those guidelines should be short
enough, so that half an hour should be sufficient for a medium-level
programmer to understand and be abble to use  them. They should give
examples of clean way of implementing common operations and things to
avoid."

Here be dragons.

So this has to be asked.  What's a continuation?  And why did my last

A continuation is pretty much a closure for control flow. If you 
think of each block as having a separate "control" scratchpad that 
notes where it's been, you can capture those along with the variable 
scratchpads. When you invoke a continuation it just puts the control 
frames back at the same time it puts the variable frames back.

Goodness knows, mailman is totally weird. I think it has a failure mode
where the local MTA doesn't accept one of the recipients straight away,
and mailman RSETs the SMTP connection there and then, and only delivers
all the recipients when they can all be accepted by the local MTA. I
could tweak colon's MTA to do something like this, but I'm slightly
loathe to do so. It also gives me an incentive to write cd-mlm.

Perl idioms for C programmers? OK.

1) Regular expressions are usually the most efficient way of doing things,
even if they can be a little impenetrable.

2) $_ is very useful. Normally you try and get the variable you're working
on into $_, so that you can edit it, print it, etc. without having to keep
stating the variable name explicitly.

3) Use of short-circuiting operators.
  $a&&print
is more idiomatic than 
  print if$a
or
  if($b){print}

4) Never use semi-colons at the end of blocks or your program.
  for$i(1..10){$_*=$i;print}
not
  for$i(1..10){$_*=$i;print;}

5) Leave out any superfluous space. Save whitespace for Python. So in the
previous example, you should never write anything like
  for $i (1..10) {
    $_ *= $i;
    print
  }

6) Never use tr///. y/// is always one stroke better.

Not always; it depends on which tie-breaker you are using:

BTW, I really like the shiny ball book by Joseph N Hall
for teaching Perl idioms to C programmers.

Assuming that (1) wasn't part of the joke, I'd put the number one rule
as "use hashes" ("use regexs" is number two).

A C programmer will think of linked lists, pointers etc etc. Throw them
all away and use a hash. Linked list? Nah - use a hash. Tree? Nah - use
a hash.

The other rule of thumb is if you find yourself writing a C-style 'for'
loop, there is probably a better way to do what you want.

But there are a number of culture shocks. I can just about remember some
of mine:

Strings can have nulls in, and don't end with nulls.

Scalars are numbers and/or strings, whichever you want and you don't
need to worry about which they are (bitwise operators excepted).

"Local" isn't like C dynamic storage (I learned perl before "my"
existed. Simpler rule nowadays is to ignore "local".)

Beware that 0 is false. (Applies to all perl programers :-)

I approved this because of its relevance to this thread, but I feel that
it's not necessarily right to approve posts by people not subscribed to
the list in general.

Interesting. the list of ways to write faster perl in my talk for YAPC::EU
on "when perl is not quite fast enough" also had hashes at number one,
regexps at number 2, and pack/unpack at number 3. So I was thinking in
the same way as you when I wrote that (last week)

>So this has to be asked.  What's a continuation?

I like to think of a continuation as a reified return address. It
allows you to get extra control over what to do next. In most languages,
control-flow is expressed by the syntax of the language, so

	int twice(int i) {
		return 2 * i;
	}

the return statement is syntax that represents a jump to the return
address with attached data. It has built-in knowledge that the next to
do is to continue in the calling function.  But if we make the return
address into a variable, then

	twice(int i, int_cont ret) {
		ret(2 * i);
	}

we've made the return look more like a function call, and we've made
the implicit return address explicit, and therefore open to manipulation.

Continuations are very powerful, especially when you introduce the
call-with-current-continuation function, which is usually named callcc.
In a language where continuations are usually implicit, it allows you
to make them explicit.

	typedef void (*int_cont)(int);
	int callcc(int (*f)(cont));

	int wombat(cont c) {
		return 10;
	}
	int echidna(cont c) {
		c(10);
	}

The statements callcc(wombat) and callcc(echidna) have the same value:
calling the continuation is like returning from the function. However,
if the continuation is passed down to other functions it becomes a
non-local return, like longjmp in C or die in Perl.  For example you
can do exception handling with them:

	int myopen(const char *file, int_cont exn) {
		int fd = open(file, O_RDONLY);
		if (fd < 0)
			exn(errno);
		else
			return(fd);
	}

	int doit(int_cont exn) {
		int fd = myopen("/etc/passwd", exn);
		/* crack some passwords */
		return 0;
	}

	if (callcc(doit) == 0) {
		/* ok */
	} else {
		/* we returned directly here from the failed
		call to open(), skipping the passwd cracking */
	}

Things get much more hairy if you allow functions to return continuations
up the call stack (which can't work with a traditional stack for the
same reasons that int *f() { int i; return &i; } is bad -- you need heap-
allocated activation frames instead). This allows you to implement things
like coroutines etc.

Cool!  Thanks for those examples, Tony.  Now I know that even though I
had no idea what a continuation was, I used to use them quite frequently
in Z80 assembly language programs if I wanted to modify where a
subroutine was going to return to...

Mmm, curry.  I'm guessing it'll be busy.  Is 11am too early for a

It isn't too early, because you want to be in Embankment not long after:

Hi cam.pm folks,

This is just a brief email to say hello and to let you know that I've joined 
the cam.pm mailing list: I'm a recent chemistry graduate who lives in 
Shelford and who's been programming Perl on and off for about two years now. 
Hopefully, I'll be able to drop by the next cam.pm meeting also to say hello 
in person.

I'll probably lurk for a while to get the 'feel' of the list but I look 
forward to discussing Perl and related stuff in the near future.

Cheers,

Gaz Morris

Welcome.  Do you use perl to do chemistry?  Everyone else is being quiet,
and some of us are recovering from YAPC::Europe.

I would have like to have done, given that my master's project was on the 
use of web-accessible databases in chemistry - including building one - but 
I was forced to use PHP instead because the maintainer (my tutor) didn't 
know Perl and didn't see any particular reason to bother learning it 
(sigh...)

I mostly fool around with Perl for a bit of fun: The last thing I wrote was 
a cobbled-together <a 
href='http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=194335'>Texas Hold 'ems 
tool</a>, which told you how likely you were to win with a given hand. I've 
rewritten it as an object-oriented module, which removed most of the nasty 
cruft and it reads much better now.

Does anyone know why my keyboard/mouse might have suddenly started giving
me electric shocks every half an hour or so?  It's got our local techie

Hmmmmm - I'm guessing that your keyboard and mouse are made out of plastic ?
Whilst its unlikely to be this since plastic generally doesn't conduct
electricity, it could be down to a dodgy earth on the plug to the machine,
either in the plug or socket on the machine. I've seen some fun results
where a machine's earth was floating at around 70V and was happily earthing
itself across its network connection to another machine. This was only noticed
when people realised that 10Base2 connections *really* shouldn't produce a
spark when you unplug them.

It could also be a static shock as well.

Okay, please note I'm not taking the piss.....

Change your tights and or shoes. Had this once at a place I worked, had a
girl that would regularly take out machines due to large static shocks.
Turned out she was generating a huge amount of static electricity.

The other thing to do is to get an anti-static mat put under your desk and
chair, ideally with some form of grounding. That helps to prevent the build
up of static electricity.

Frying your motherboard by static electricity is considered bad form btw :-)

OK. I have no idea why this might happen, but it's absolutely shocking.

You have accidentally created the uber-Drosophila.  It escaped last night
and secreted a tiny perpetual-motion machine in your keyboard, which is
generating the electricity.  The fly is hiding in a crack in the ceiling
and is laughing at you.

Of course allocation of namespace should be done on the length of time the
actual place has been in existance, that way the sceptics would always loose
:-)

I'd argue for

Cambridge (The original and the best) Perlmongers

but I think I need more parentheses for clarity

(Cambridge (The original and the best)) Perlmongers


Mainly because pedants in the US will try to argue that they are living
somewhere just as real as the town in the fens, but I believe they'll have
a hard time arguing that their Cambridge is the original. Hopefully
everyone can see that "best" is totally subjective, and not worth arguing
about in a pedantic logic based argument. Although I suspect that it will
raise emotions. :-)

Nah. Should read:

Cambridge (The one that actually meets) Perlmongers

The Cambridge, MA group is rather... low key. In the two years I 
worked in Cambridge, I don't think they actually had a meeting, and 
nobody from Boston.pm (which is just across the sludge^Wriver) had 
heard of one either.

Does Boston.pm meet? If so we should force Cambridge.pm to merge with
them so that we can have the name :-)

Yep, boston.pm meets. They're one of the more active US groups--tech 
meeting every month, with 20 or more people showing. (At least for 
the meetings I've gone to, and I was going pretty regularly for a

Sorry it's a one worder, but my brain is otherwise not working.

You've probably read about this elsewhere, but I don't think I've directly
plugged it to the cam.pm list yet, so here goes:

		 $$$ Make The Perl Foundation money fast $$$

I, Nicholas Clark, hereby offer 6 rewards, each of 100 guineas, to be paid
to the Perl Foundation, for the the first article deemed to be "good enough"
by my judges, in each of the following categories:

  * INTERCAL is better than perl

  * Brainfuck is better than perl

  * Befunge is better than perl

  * $foo is better than perl (three rewards)


100 guineas in real money is 105 pounds sterling. (about $160 or 160 Euros at
current exchange rates).  The intent is to make fun of articles which are of
the form "my language is better than your language". $foo here is any language
that makes a suitably funny subject when compared with perl in this style.

Schwern and Greg McCarroll are the judges; please send your articles (and any
questions) to spoofathon@perl.org.

You can bribe the judges using https://donate.perl-foundation.org/ :-)

No. First entry in each category that is "good enough" wins. There aren't
likely to be that many entries, so I don't want to feel forced to reward
the least bad entry that arrives within some deadline, particularly if
one category has no strong entries, but another has several really strong
entries.

Slightly more explanation of the "good enough" thing is at

Hi all,

Im having a bit of a problem when trying to install bioperl.

During the make test the following occurs:-

############################################################################

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"

"test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/*.t

t/AAChange................ok

t/AAReverseMutate.........ok

t/AlignIO.................ok

t/Allele..................ok

t/Alphabet................ok

t/Annotation..............ok

t/Biblio..................ok

t/Biblio_biofetch.........ok 3/13

-------------------- WARNING ---------------------

MSG: 500 (Internal Server Error) Can't connect to www.ebi.ac.uk:80

(Bad hostname 'www.ebi.ac.uk')

Client-Date: Tue, 05 Nov 2002 22:50:49 GMT

 

 

---------------------------------------------------

Warning: Couldn't connect to BioFetch server with Bio::DB::Medline.pm!

t/Biblio_biofetch.........ok 14/13 

############################################################################

And so on-

I have set my environment variable to point to my proxy and using the

tests in libwww and libnet all is well and I can get access to the

outside world.

It appears that env_proxy variable is not being picked up in

LWP::UserAgent.

When I generate scripts using:-

############################################################

my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent;

$ua->proxy('http', 'http://gatekeeper.xxx.xxxxx.xx:80/');

$ua->no_proxy('xxx.xxxxx.xx');

$ua->timeout(900); 

############################################################

All is well and I can get to the outside world.

 

Can anyone advise on why or how to force the LWP::UserAgent to use the

proxy environment variables?

Many thanks,

Brian

Have you tried asking the bioperl list?  I don't use it much as they don't
do microarray stuff (yet) and the learing curve is a little steeper than I
currently have time for.  Can I be nosy and ask what kind of
bioinformatics you're doing?

This is your 5 day warning.  The next social will be on Friday 15th
November and Sebi will be coming to visit from the wilds of London.  The
Castle has been busy the last few times I've been in, so does anyone have
suggestions for a venue?  I'm informed the Maypole does mulled wine.

In other news, Emmet is over from Canada next week if anyone wants to
catch up over a pint.  Plus, Nick is still looking for entries for the
"Why X is better than perl" spoofathon.

There will also be an MBM from the wilds of London, I suspect.

Venue is needed, yeah.

My personal opinion would be that the Maypole does not particularly good
beer and not particularly good food, so I'd prefer somewhere else.

Not sure I have too many good suggestions, though.

When is Friday night, from about 1900-1930-ish until pub chucking out
time.

Where is currently not decided, but unless anyone objects by about
lunchtime tomorrow, I'm going to assert the County Arms (Castle Hill) as
MBM and I both think it's a good idea.

Cheers,

Phil

Now asserted. If anyone's thinking of turning up and doesn't know where
the County is:

http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?P2M?P=CB30AH&Z=1

aka 'opposite the Castle'.

So, in the summer, I suggested in
  http://www.cam.pm.org/archive/2002-May/000761.html
that we should have a small programming contest. I learnt a number of things
from this, such as appropriate amounts of time, etc. I've also been known
to do little fun programs at christmas time, with an approximately
christmassy theme - eg:
  http://www.cam.pm.org/archive/2001-December/000489.html

So, it seemed pretty obvious that I could combine the two. The rules on the
entries will be stricter, and the prize will be more tangible.

The rules are very simple:
* a valid programme entry (such as the example below) can be overlaid by
  the template below in such a way that the characters in the entry are
  non-whitespace if the corresponding character in the template is a "#"
  and that they are whitespace if the corresponding character is a " ".
  Trailing space will be ignored.
  (Tabs will be rendered as " " to the nearest tabstop, and tabstops
  occur every 8 characters). Entries not conforming will be rejected as
  part of the competition, but may well end up in the final summary.

* Entries must be submitted to christmas-perl@cam.pm.org by
  2003-01-01 00:00:01

* Multiple entries are allowed per person

* Entries should be submitted with any environment variables, such as
  LINES or COLUMNS, that might need setting. No non-standard environment
  variables will be allowed from the command line. Setting the tty modes
  using stty(1) shall also be allowed, and other such I/O settings. Forms
  of any required arguments would also be good, or files that need to be
  opened.

* Entries are considered secret by the judges until the announcement of
  the winner and the publication of the summaries (this publication will
  be announced on the cam.pm list). Copyright of the entry remains with
  the original author, but the competition judges, and cam.pm are granted
  a non-exclusive licence to be able to publish such code, and include it
  on the cam.pm website.

* Pick one or more of perl 5.005_03 / 5.6.1 / 5.8.0

* The prize will be a bottle of wine, to be presented at the next available
  opportunity after the announcement of the winner.

* Open to anyone who would like to submit (except for organisers of the
  competition, obviously)

* The winner will be the most interesting programme to decipher and
  understand. Extra credit will be given for algorithmic obfuscation,
  interesting techniques of using the space allowed, and pretty results.
  The judges' decision shall be final.

So, while you're sitting there trying to deal with the amount of turkey
you've eaten, then see if you can come up with a programme to fit in the
snowflake, and get it in before the New Year. There are quite a few
characters to play with, and it should be possible to do something
interesting.

Happy Hacking, and good luck.

I was expecting all the code and data to fit into that template, and I
may mark it negatively, but I don't think it's completely invalid, so go
ahead and submit it.

Personally I think it's at least bad style. :)

Yes, that's my feeling, but if the rest of the entry is sufficiently
impressive, then I may well have to deal with it like that.

> (... not that I've even started thinking of an entry yet ...)

I've intentionally left it a lot longer than the last one, but colin, you
*have* to do one after the last entry!

I can do a trivial demo of my code with a small amount of data in the
template, but will need more to show it really doing something useful.

My first idea was to do ... errm, exactly the same as mbm's example,
so I'm doing something way funkier instead.

[beware of the cross-posting]

I decided what I was going to write, wrote it, but then ran out of
enthusiasm* and couldn't be bothered to munge it to fit the template.
However, because it may be of interest, what I wrote is below.

* - or more accurately, I had a crack-addled idea for a far less sane way
of solving this problem, and decided to implement that instead

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#
# Given a list of all connections in a graph like this, this program finds
# a shortest route between two nodes.  All edges are assumed to be of
# equal length and bi-directional, and transitting a node is assumed to
# have zero cost.

How are 'character' and 'whitespace' defined?

One of my co-workers has taken to referring to the pub next to my work as
``the gym'', after another co-worker was weak-willed in exactly the same way
one Friday evening... :-)

I feel "codepoint" and "thing that matches /\s/" respectively, is probably
appropriate, if you're going to bring Unicode madness into it...

*laugh* well, I suppose you get some resistance training from the action of
moving pint from table to mouth :) And then there is balance training in the
form of moving several pints of beer from bar to table as well :)

I've forgotten if there was an acceptable list of perl versions published in
the rules. The UTF8 regexp code is not perfect, and several bugs have been
fixed in the development version, and merged across into 5.8.1-to-be.

Mainly bugs to do with matches and other upper/lower casing on $1 (etc) from a
previous match, such as this code:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

for my $a (0,1) {
  $_ = 'readin,database,readout';
  if ($ARGV[0])  {
    $_ .= chr 256;
    chop;
  }
  /(.+)/;

  my @d = split /[,]/,$1;
  print join (':',@d), "\n";
}
__END__

Without any arguments (not utf8) I see:

readin:database:readout
readin:database:readout

with $ARGV[1] true, in 5.8.0 I see:

#adin:database:readout
readin:database:readout

The bug has been found and fixed by AMS in the development tree. They seem to
related to how things like uppercase tables get initialised the first time
they are used.

There was:

  * Pick one or more of perl 5.005_03 / 5.6.1 / 5.8.0

So are we allowed to rely on bugs in specified versions even if they
only occur on certain platforms? :-)

No :) I'll give the gym a miss on wednesday and head to the pub instead if
other people are going to turn up as well.

Now, which pub ?

I've decided to have a trip to NYC next spring, for various reasons.
According to Expedia, there are lots of good deals in March.  I'm going to
tempt organisational doom and ask if anyone fancies coming along.
Alternatively, any advice on where to stay, what to see, etc?

Recursion is overrated, man. And I thought Perl programmers were all
about being lazy...

my @routemap =3D map {

	['London', 'Hastings'],
	['Croydon', 'Brighton'],

	['Lewes', 'Eastbourne'],
	['Eastbourne', 'Hastings']
);

my ($dep, $dest) =3D @ARGV[0, 1];
# undef means infinite/not reachable.
my %cost_to =3D ( $dep =3D> 0 );
my %came_from;

my $changed =3D 0;
while(1)
{
	$changed =3D 0;
	for my $route (@routemap)
	{
		my ($here, $there) =3D @{$route};
		if(defined($cost_to{$here})
			&& (not defined($cost_to{$there})
				|| ($cost_to{$there} > $cost_to{$here} + 1)))
		{
			$cost_to{$there} =3D $cost_to{$here} + 1;
			$came_from{$there} =3D $here;
			$changed =3D 1;
		}
	}
	last unless $changed;
}

unless(defined($cost_to{$dest}))
{
	print "can't get to $dest from $dep\n";
	exit 1;
}

print "Preferred route from $dep to $dest is: ($cost_to{$dest} jumps)\n\t";
my @route =3D ( $dest );
while(defined($came_from{$dest}))
{
	$dest =3D $came_from{$dest};
	unshift @route, $dest;
}
print join(" -> ", @route). "\n";

----8<----

Rough estimate: O(l*n) average, O(n^2) worst case time and O(n) space,
where l is the length of the shortest route and n the size of @routemap.
I make no guarantees I've checked this claim thoroughly...

Hmm. For some reason this reminded me I've still this week's ISIHAC[0]
to listen to. Better make use of the fat JANET pipes while I'm still
here, I suppose... ^_^

Do the Circle Line cruise. It's a  boat trip that goes all the way
round Manhattan. It's fab.

Oh, and Ellis Island is well worth a visit too.

Obviously try to meet up with ny.pm and show them how to drink. See
if you can get them to take you to Two Boots afterwards - they serve
the best pizza I've ever eaten.

Sounds good to me; hopefully see people tonight then :)

Assuming nothing blows up at work that is.

Yet another programming competition, for those who want to avoid
socialising over Christmas ;P

Subject: Winter programming competition!

The Computing Society is running a programming competition. The goal
is to write a program to play a virtual version of the simple game,
Connect Four. Microsoft have kindly offered to sponsor us with an XBox
prize, and the writers of the best entries will be considered for a
University-wide team to compete in the upcoming BCS programming
competition. That should be plenty of incentive - so get coding!

More information is available on the CUCS website:

        http://www.cucs.ucam.org/competition.html
        http://www.cucs.ucam.org/

and the deadline for submissions is 28 January

Oh we are.  The recursive solution is incredibly easy to write, anything
else would require at least a little bit of thought.  Bearing in mind what
this was written for, performance isn't really that important.

And why not.

Hmm.. a quick google shows at least two programs claiming to be perfect
players, one of which is an on-line java applet.
There's a Dutch master's thesis on solving connect4 (the first player
wins on the standard 7x6 board; it's a draw for less-tall boards).
The perfect solvers seem to use a combination of results from this and
an 8-ply opening book.

Stiff competition....

The winner is Pete Clay, with a close runner-up of Andrew Savige.

Congratulations, Pete, and you'll get your bottle of wine at the next
cam.pm meet - yes, lucy, that's a hint.... :-)

Full details are available at: http://cam.pm.org/christmasppc.shtml

I'm sorry that so few people entered, though it was a difficult template
to fit code into.

I forgot to mention, this was in part because I started taking apart
his entry and said "You evil bastard" several times while trying to
produce the reformatted text.

CVS is the lowest-common-denominator version control system, and I know a
lot of people use it. Does anyone use anything else, especially something
that supports atomic commits? In particular, I'm looking at Subversion and
trying to decide if it's safe yet.

ObPerl: http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/cgi-bin/psview?document=/ira/2000/5
may be useful for advocacy; it's a comparison of scripting languages
against compiled languages, and the scripts come out better.

IME Subversion is excellent; I keep large parts of my home directory in
it these days. The main outstanding problems I've run into are:

  - doesn't yet version symlinks
  - no 'cvs annotate' analogue
  - doesn't do SSL certificate handling (but see below)

Still, for that and the stuff at
http://subversion.tigris.org/inconveniences.html you get atomic commits,
proper renames and directory metadata, offline operation for a lot more
things than CVS, and so on. As far as safety is concerned, I've had no
problems, although I run 'svnadmin dump' from cron nightly just in case.

If you want to avoid the Apache2 dependency, there's a relatively new
repository access layer called ra_svn, which can be tunnelled over ssh.
You probably want to be using at least 0.16.1 for this; I haven't tried
it yet myself.

That reminds me.  I need to generate some new meeting dates and learn
CVS.  Or MBM will kill me.  It's been brought to my attention that there
are lots of perl things happening this year, but none of them are in the
UK:

 German Perl Workshop  5th-7th March
 YAPC::Israel          12th May
 YAPC::Canada          15th-16th May
 The Perl Whirl        1st-9th June
 OSCON (Feat. TPC)     7th-11th July
 YAPC::NA              16th-18th July (unconfirmed dates)
 YAPC::Europe          ????
 YAPC::Asia::Taiwan    ????

I should have answered at the beginning. It worries me some that the data
is stored in a database, rather than in plain text files. Mainly because
of the content of the repository, and how important it can be.

I just said that I thought you should make it your New Year's resolution
to be able to commit changes to the website. :-)

I'm wondering at what point it might be worth seeing if we can do a cam.pm
technical meeting of some kind (rather like the london.pm ones).

The dump format's portable, though (well, they've changed it a couple of
times, but there's always a flag branch and a documented procedure for
migration). A trivial script like
http://riva.ucam.org/svn/cjwatson/bin/svn-backup is enough to generate
plain-text backups that you can if necessary edit by hand and reload.

I was worried about this at first too, but it makes sense when
considering how to overcome some of the obvious deficiencies of CVS and
dump/load seems to alleviate robustness problems.

I've offered education a few times; just need to arrange a time when
we're both in and both inclined to do this sort of stuff. :)

Subject: LCN 2003/01

Welcome to the London Community News.
Details are for the month of January 2003.

After a long hiatus the LCN is back, starting from February the LCN will
be a monthly(ish) email detailing the who, where and when of local user
groups and other relevant events. An online version of the current LCN
can be found at http://www.unixdaemon.net as soon as i actually put it up.

This month Thursday the 16th seems to be the hot spot with Lonix, the
FreeBSD user group and a UKUUG talk on IPV6 happening at the same time.

The User Groups:
-----------------------------------

FreeBSD UKUG
Homepage: http://www.freebsd-uk.eu.org/

The FreeBSD UKUG is a users' group based in the UK for UK FreeBSD
UNIX Users. This months meeting is being held on Thursday 16th
January at the Star Tavern in Belgravia, London. Details are in
the mailing list at:
http://listserver.uk.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-users/2003-January/00715
7.html

A map can be found here:
http://grault.net/cgi-bin/grubstreet.pl?Star_Tavern,_SW1X_8HT

-----------------------------------

GLLUG
Home Page: http://gllug.linux.co.uk/
Meeting Page: http://gllug.linux.co.uk/meeting-20030118.html
Meeting Time: Saturday 18th January 2003, between 12noon and 5pm.

Greater London Linux User Group's (GLLUG) purpose is to bring together
London's Linux users so they can share experiences and expertise (or
revel in their inexperience and quest for expertise), to chat about the
state of the (Linux) world, that sort of thing.

We try to arrange meets so that there is space for users to set up
their equipment, so you are welcome to bring your kit along, either to
go through the problems you are having or just to show off what you are
up to.

There are no formalities to attending a GLLUG meeting, no subscription
or entry fees, you can just turn up on the day. We welcome and encourage
new and inexperienced users, young and old.

This months GLLUG has talks on: Security Enhanced Linux by Russell Coker
MySQL by MySQL.com's very own Carsten H. Pederson

GLLUG meetings are now happening a lot more often thanks to the
organisation of the GLLUG Kabel and the very kind Westminster University
who have provided us with a home for the last few meetings. Facilities
available include the large lecture theater, the network lab for both help
installing systems and interactive demos and the multimedia room which
can be used for users kit and has a handy supply of monitors keyboards
and mice, saving you the fun of lugging them through London on a Saturday.

We are fortunate this month to also have Josette from O'Reilly on site
selling books and John Winters from The Linux Emporium with box sets
and CDs. Due to FOSDEM in February and the number of GLLUG members that
attend this may be the last meeting before March/April so come along
and join the fun.

-----------------------------------

LonBUG
Homepage: http://www.juiceco.com/html/lonbug.html

A user group for the Free, Open and NetBSD communities.

A group of individuals who share an interest in Net, Free and Open BSD's.
We meet monthly for a few beers and to chat, share opinions, tales of
battle with lusers etc...

I have no details about the meeting this month and the server is putting
out 403's. If anyone has any information as to if this group still exists
can you drop me a note.

-----------------------------------

London Perl Mongers
Home Page: http://london.pm.org
Meetings: http://london.pm.org/meetings/

London PM are a group who are dedicated to the encouragement of all
things Perl-like in London. Since the last LCN Paul Mison has finished his
successful stint as head cat herder and a new victim has been nominated,
Mark Fowler of the Perl Advent Calendar fame.

There are two meetings this month, a social and a technical, on the 9th
and 23rd respectively. Maps and details of the public transport available
to the venue can both be found on the meetings page given above. Just
ignore the orange borders.

-----------------------------------

Lonix
Home Page: http://www.lonix.org.uk/
Contact Email: info@lonix.org.uk

The aim of Lonix is quite straightforward although it comprises of many
points. The overall aim is to unite many Linux individuals in and around
London. Below is a list of aims, but you as a member may not agree to
all of them. (Hopefully at least one!)

Meet like minded individuals to share ideas and discuss opinions.
To provide a Linux force in London to persuade the industry to opt
for a more Linux friendly approach to their services and products.
To assist users with problems, providing advice and physical help,
do Linux advocacy and drink too much.

Date Thur 16 Jan 2003
Time 6.00pm onwards
Place Los Locos - 24,26 Russell Street, WC2B 5HF
                  Nearest Tube Covent Garden

For those of you that still have working livers after the Xmas excess
details about the nights activities and a map can be found on the meeting
page (http://www.lonix.org.uk/tnet-cgi/Lonix?CODE=userMeetings)

SAGE-WISE
Home Page: http://www.sage-wise.org/

SAGE-WISE is the System Administrators Guild for Wales, Ireland, Scotland
and England, hence the "-WISE" suffix. Our aim is to form a professional
association for system administrators in the UK and Ireland.

But what is a system administrator?

Professional system administrators, however, often look after large
numbers of computers and networks - they are the people who keep the
systems running, repair faulty discs, install and debug new software,
upgrade existing systems, and generally take care of the computing
resources needed for their users to perform their tasks effectively. A
shorter definition is "A system administrator is one who manages computers
not solely for his or her own use". If you know the joys and frustrations
of this then feel free to come and visit one of our meetings.

Community Recognition:

In this section I'd like to include people or companies that
have contributed or helped one or more of the user groups in some way.
A lot of people quietly contribute time, money or effort and get no
recognition for it. This month I'd like to thank:

Dave Cantrell
For hosting the Unixdaemon website this is going to appear upon.

Westminster University
For the three excellent and well stocked rooms
taken over by GLLUG on a frequent basis.

Santa Claus For my Stargate DVD's

---------------------------

Any comments (Good or bad), suggestions of groups to add or ideas
for recognition of services to London Community groups are welcome at
dean.wilson3@virgin.net If any of the user group details are incorrect
or out of date please let me know. Starting from next month the LCN will
be produced via the magic of Template Toolkit and Net::SMTP

An online version of the current LCN will be available at
http://www.unixdaemon.net Real Soon Now. If you are on a group
mailing list that would be interested in the LCN and i've missed it please
let me know and I'll add it to the distribution list.

Thanks to the organizers of these events for sending me the details. Any
typos or spelling mistakes are probably mine.

I'll be in the Star tonight too, although for a different reason.  I'm
sure I'll pop upstairs and say hello at some point; we may even be
herded upstairs en masse (fear not; that's for fairly small values of
"masse").

We may end up being downstairs owing to Mark's wheelchair :-) I hope
there's enough space.

It seemed to work out well despite the double-booking of the upstairs
room.  And I came home with a little beanbag devil.  Am I allowed to
ask who the pretty girl was or will I get yelled at for scaring women
away from the geek community?

I had an interesting conversation with a couple of people who were
complaining that they tried to install a perl module and "it decided
to reinstall perl for me".  I suggested they try CPANPLUS instead of
CPAN.pm.  I hope that was the right suggestion; I wouldn't know since
I hand-install things that don't come in debian packages in the version
I want.

Anyone else planning on going to this?  I'm going to, if I get up in
time.  I need to be in a pub at 4pm though.

So, I went to london.pm's techmeet last night, and one of the people talking
was someone I went to school with, but haven't seen for 7 years. He was
demonstrating some of the sigs that he wrote in obfuscated and often
golf-style perl.

I think they're worth a look, personally.

I've been pondering that as well - I think it must be the cold weather ('twas
-6C last night) slowing everyone down :)

How about we use the Carlton Arms this time ? Has the advantage of a
non-smoking lounge bar completely separate to the public bar and which has
nice comfortable sofa-type-things. Its owned by someone from CAMRA which
should give you an idea of the sort of beer available :)

The only downside is that they don't do food yet (should do RSN apparently).

[The fact that its also the closest pub to both myself and Lucy's place is]
[by-the-by as well :)                                                     ]

Streetmap link, and a few website commits would be a good plan!

Yeah, yeah.  I'm still desperately trying to catch up after being held
captive in a hotel basement in Brighton.  The Carlton Arms is on Carlton
Way off Gilbert Road.  If you think this is too far north then
suggestions for next month are welcome.  I'll be there from 7ish
(depending on when I get out of a seminar and how long it takes to walk).

Cool; I should probably note that the lounge bar is accessed by the door on
the left hand side of the pub.

I'll probably appear around 8pm or so since I'm doing my normal gym bunny
impression on Friday after work.

The lounge bar of the Carlton Arms is not large, so you won't have a
problem finding us in there.

Just look for the large group of people with purple varnished nails.

Hey, that wasn't me!  Mine are currently short and nail coloured in an
attempt not to stab myself.  I'll try and remember to bring the (small)

*thwap* Don't scare people off - lets lull them into a false sense of 
security first - then pounce and paint their nails for them *grin*

Good point by Graham though I've heard several times here and on l.pm. 
I think it would be useful to have thumbnail photos of members linked
off the web page so at least you'd have an idea who to look for. It's 
also kinda nice to have face/name/irc_nick too. I'll volunteer to put 
one together if people will send me ones they like of themselves -
probably face/shoulders but whatever you prefer.

I've finally got around to adding some primitive support for
MBM's cam.pm programming contests to Acme::EyeDrops:
 http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Acme-EyeDrops
See the new "Snowflakes" sub-section in Examples section
(function pour_text in EyeDrops.pm does the work).
Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

I wonder if other competitors wrote some sort of shape-pouring
program to lessen the torture of manually fitting their program
into that annoying snowflake shape. If so, I would be interested
to see the code.

Scarily, I did mine by hand. The shape was badly chosen, and I've
learnt from it. :-) In mine, I needed several noops in various places
( "". was very useful, for example). I also needed to reorder operations,
but of course, you have to decide which operations you're allowed to
reorder. :-) I suppose, thinking about it, that some techniques can be
taken from polymorphic virus writing.

I'd seen it before, but (a) it didn't have the feature that would have

Don't do that, you might bring about the end of the world ..

/me has been fiddling with Jam. Like Perl, it's the kind of language where
things like $(>[1]) > $(<[1]) ; seem reasonable.

 Hi,

 One of my cow-orkers would like to get our employer to pay for her to
learn perl.  AIUI she knows the very basics, can anyone recommend a
good basic-to-advanced level perl course?

Woo, a new subscriber.

Perl[1] is fun, yes. Network design ought to be, but I'm currently trying to
renumber and restructure my home network without shutting down any machines,
and also moving to having a defaultless core (all routes being advertised by
RIP).

[1] with that capitalisation, please. :-) the reason being that PERL is what
    bad webmonkeys "programme" in.[2]
[2] me, snobbish? never!

This list has been a bit quiet recently, unfortunately, but then I know that
I haven't done much interesting in Perl recently, I'm not that interested in
the project I'm currently doing at work, though the one that might come up
soon looks exceedingly cool. I'll probably end up using a fair bit of Perl/Tk
for that.

Anyway, Lucy, what this means is that you need to organise another social
meeting.

Me neither, apart from weird bug tracking system hacking; although that
would probably be much the same in any language as it's the problem
that's difficult rather than the implementation. In fact I suspect the
code I've been writing over the last couple of days may have to be
translated into Python in order to fit into the right place in another
deployed system ...

Or you need to organize another obfuscation/golf contest while

Oh ... my most recent hacking has actually been on a system which uses a
piece of code first developed by suggestion on this list (to do with dates
and Cambridge terms)

Hey all,

	I just mentioned the fact that I'm going to be on holiday 
in Cambridge in mid-May to the folks on rhizo #perl. Nicholas suggested
I ping the list and see if anyone might be up for a beer on the evening 
of the 13th. So...anyone up for beer on the evening of May 13?

	Best,
	Jesse (obra)

Helloooo.  Holiday?  In Cambridge?  Weird ;)  I hereby declare the next
social to be on May 13th (which is a Tuesday).  Someone suggest a pub
slightly nearer to the city centre than the Carlton Arms (so we don't
confuse our visitor).

For those who haven't yet heard, this year's YAPC is July 23-25 in Paris
(http://yapc.mongueurs.net/).  I've already pre-registered seeing as last
year's conference cured my insomnia for at least a coupla weeks.

BooK has made a stats page:   http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/stats/

The UK is only 3 people ahead of France. If one more cam.pm person
registers then cam.pm moves up to joint fifth.

There, isn't that dull.

Meanwhile in other news, there is a perl foundation survey at

http://www.perlfoundation.org/index.cgi?page=survey

They'd like to know where you'd like them to spend money. If you like what
they've been spending money on tell them. If you'd like them to spend money
on something else (travel grants to the Bahamas for academics using perl,
getting someone to fix bugs in bioperl, swish flash animations to navigate
through CPAN, etc) tell them.

If I thought there was the remotest possibility of anyone doing it, I'd 
have suggested funding a port of perl to Palm OS.

Well, Nicolai Plum, whom I suspect some of you know, offered me a nice
spare bedroom and after careening madly around germany for 10 days, I
suspect it'll be a tad more relaxing than london...

This is probably too far in the future to make any firm plans,
but it seems that I'll be giving a course in Perl at a BioPerl
conference thing that's happening in Hinxton on June 24th. Unless
I'm mistaken that's in your area so I wondered if anyone would
a) be at the conference or b) fancy an orange juice or two in
the evening.

I don't know of anyone who'll be at the conference, but I'm sure we can
manage the OJ ;)

Nope.  Or not until my sunburn heals and I can actually wear clothes

OK, I give up.  A script I wrote a while ago now says
 main::read_config() called too early to check prototype
   at /usr/bin/chiark-named-conf line 262.
and the like - a dozen or two, depending on exactly how it's run.

I've googled, I've RTFMd, and there is no standard answer to this
question AFAICT.  Typing `called too early to check prototype' into
Google is very illuminating, in fact - lots of other people have this
problem, but the answers they seem to be getting are unhelpful at
best.

So:

1. Where should I have looked to find the answer to this ?

2. If the answer to 1 is `it's not properly documented', then
   could someone please explain to me what I need to do to my script ?

3. Why oh why oh why oh why do the Perl maintainers keep pulling shit
   like this ?  I only just had them `fix' the `bug' which made $^F
   not work, the resulting change breaking a program I wrote some time
   before 1994.  If Perl isn't careful they'll find people writing Tcl
   instead to take advantage of its superior API stability.

For now I've grepped for all the function definitions in the script,
turned them into declarations, and stuck them all in a big list near
the top of the script.  This has bad the symptoms go away but is quite
ugly.

Ian.

perldiag(1):

       %s() called too early to check prototype
           (W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype
           before the parser saw a definition or declaration for it,
           and Perl could not check that the call conforms to the pro-
           totype.  You need to either add an early prototype declara-
           tion for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine
           definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype check-
           ing.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling
           the function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the
           name to avoid the warning.  See perlsub.

Alternatively you can dump the error message into splain(1).

It's an extra optional warning. I don't see how adding extra optional
warnings for dubious constructs (in this case functions with prototypes
that aren't being checked; presumably if you added a prototype then you
wanted it to be checked rather than silently ignored?) counts as broken.

I would suggest simply putting function definitions before their uses so
that Perl can check their prototypes in the obvious way, adding extra
forward declarations only where necessary (mutual recursion). I
generally find this to be a clearer style anyway.

Ahh.  Just goes to show Google isn't perfect.  (I grepped
/usr/share/doc/perl-doc too but didn't grep the manpages ...)

The <FILE> in while(<FILE>) reads in a line, the <FILE> in $line=<FILE> reads 
in the next. So $line only ever gets to be every other line, only the lines 
without the >.

Ignore that.  I usually use while ($line=<FILE>) but boredom sucked that
fact from my brain.

[ Bit quiet in here, isn't it? ]

Assume I have an array containing data, an (equally-sized) array containing
whether each data point is valid or not and I wish to select all
elements from the data for which the selector is true

eg from 

@data = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
@selector = ( 0, 1, 1, 0 )

I wish to obtain @valid = ( 2, 3 )

Obviously there are lots of ways of doing this, but are there any which
don't involve use of a temporary variable (or trashing the contents of
@data or @valid)? The closest I can get is

{
  my $i = 0;
  @valid = map { $_->[0] } grep { $_->[1] } map { [$_, $selector[$i++]] } @data;
}

use Language::Functional also springs to mind...

Cheers,

Phil

I'd be inclined to do it with:

| my @valid=();
| push(@valid, $selector[$_] ? $data[$_] : () ) for(0..$#data);

But that's the way I think. (I tried this with an if first, but couldn't
get it to DTRT).

Of course, TIMTOWTDI.

Something like this perhaps:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my @data = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 );
my @selector = ( 0, 1, 1, 0 );

my @valid = @data[ grep { $selector[$_] } 0 .. $#selector ];

print "@valid\n";

For cheap thrills, two more:

my $i=0;
my @valid = grep $selector[$i++], @data;

my $i=0;
my @valid = map( ($data[$i++]) x $_, @selector );

You mean apart from dealing with the Cambridge soap opera and the

I've been having fun involving perl, patchdiag.xref and checking
remote Solaris systems to see what patches they need. Mmmmmm evil
perl :) Along with releasing the latest version of LJ::Simple as
well.

We could have a meet at some point I guess.

So we have some old code that does this:

	die "Invalid list name\n"
	  unless ($ENV{'LOCAL_PART'} =~ /^($listname_regexp)$/);
	$listname = $1;

The idea being that $listname is untainted. This works fine on perl-5.6.1
etc. However, on perl-5.8.0 it leaves $listname tainted. Is this a
know bug? If I add the following two-line no-op, it correctly untaints
the value:

	$listname =~ /^($listname_regexp)$/;
	$listname = $1;

GRRR. This really is very very crap.

Tony.

Hurrah!  The DNS (nearly typoed as DNA) appears to be fixed.  Slightly too
late to socialise with a visiting Jesse Vincent.  Can I persuade anyone to
come to the pub someday?

Curious. The following succeeds for me using Debian perl 5.8.0-21:

  LOCAL_PART=foo perl -Twe '
    $ENV{PATH} = "/usr/bin:/bin";
    $listname_regexp = qr/foo/;
    die "Invalid list name\n" unless ($ENV{LOCAL_PART} =~ /^($listname_regexp)$/);
    $listname = $1;
    system("echo $listname");'

I haven't tried virgin upstream 5.8.0 or 5.8.1, though.

Tech Start-up Seeks Perl Developer

We are a tech start-up developing an email service that will provide
custom email solutions to a large international professionals market; 30
million consumers worldwide.

The service is set apart from other facilities by way of technologies and
a large portfolio of profession related domain names =96 which allow users
to create email identities that enhance their professional image and
associate them with their profession.

Awareness of the service will be raised by establishing an extensive
affiliate marketing network, word-of-mouth recommendations, and in-house
PR (our management team has past experience with driving membership based
services from zero to one million users utilising these same traffic
driving techniques.)

Revenue generation will be through annual subscription fees, phasing in
further revenue channels after usage of the service matures.

Our business model benefits from fixed technology needs and low monthly
overheads.

To prove the viability of our business model, we plan to launch a
prototype facility with minimal capital investment by end of summer 2003.

In order to keep capital requirements to a minimum during test marketing,
a team of entrepreneurial minded professionals provide their time and
experience - on a part-time basis - in exchange for part ownership in the
business.  We currently seek a Perl Developer to complete this team.

The ideal candidate will be able to make a one-off programming commitment
of 30 to 45 hours (over a 30 day period) working remotely and in parallel
with our existing team of developers to complete the initial
implementation.

Required skills include: Perl5, UNIX (FreeBSD/or Linux), Web, CGI, DBI &
DBD, MySQL

If you are interested in discussing this opportunity further, please
contact me at your earliest convenience.

I look forward to hearing from all interested parties.

Best regards

Todd Routt

Second and third opinion is that this is a bug. Would you like to report it?
Or shall I?

Er, I'm using Red Hat 9's perl, which is RPM version perl-5.8.0-88.

So, it appears (touch wood) that develooper.com have finally fixed their
nameservers so that they're returning the correct replies for the pm.org
domains, and we now have our list back.

For anyone who wondered where it was going, the technical explanation
follows:
develooper.com (who are the authority for the pm.org domain) run 
MyDNS (http://mydns.bboy.net/) on ns, ns2 and ns3.develooper.com. For
some reason (to do with the software they were running), the answers
they returned for records in a subzone had a header suggesting that
authority existed, but didn't actually return any authority RRs. Thus
most nameservers querying it would have given up and returned SERVFAIL
at that point. If you queried the NS records directly, you'd get a correct
answer, and your nameserver would then correctly cache the answer, and
you'd be able to get the answer directly.

As I was there, I suppose I do.

Autrijus did take some minutes which you can find online

Others took notes too, so more should be online soon

Sounds good. But not this week as I have no transport.

Quite a lot of people, I suspect. The question is whether anyone will
actually step up to the plate to organise something. This seems like a
job for the Fearless Leader(tm) to me.

But failing that, what's wrong with next Friday (7th Nov), or failing
that, the Friday after (14th Nov)?

Alex Gough (quidity) is coming to visit on Friday so I thought it might be
nice if we went for beer and Thai food at the Castle Inn (which is usually
quite quiet in the hellhole that is Regent Street on a Friday evening).  
Some of us buckswashlers will also be going on to the late showing of
Pirates of the Carribean at the Arts cinema.

In case you'd missed it, there's a 2003 edition of the Perl Advent 
Calender at http://www.perladvent.org/2003/  I don't know about anyone 
else, but I find all my best modules from these calendars...

Hi all,

I'm new on this list. I have been learning perl over the last 8 months,
as it is used quite a lot here at The Sanger Institute.

Everyone thinks this is great as a quick distraction, although when people
questioned me about certain words, we noticed that it drops all capitals 
from
the words, so that

Atchison

becomes

tchison

Don't know if this is intentional, or just depends on the version of 
/usr/share/dict/words
that is on the system.

Anyway, jolly good fun, and very impressive. Hope I can manage something 
like
this next year.

Cheers and a big Merry Christmas to all

Andy Brown

Oops, yes, it will, I'll have to work out a way to fix that. :-)

I forgot about stuff with capitals in /usr/share/dict/words. Damn.

For added fun, my /usr/share/dict/words (from dictionaries-common on
Debian unstable) also contains lots of apostrophes and also various
accented characters.

Debian stable's contains a few hyphens as well as "Modula-2" and
"Modula-3", and FreeBSD's has "Jean-Pierre" and "Jean-Christophe".

Perhaps the easiest would be to reject any words containing something
outside [a-z]?

Cheers,

Phil

I got rid of those already. hence y/[a-z]//cd (which is why the capitals
don't work...)

Just in case you haven't seen it, if you really want to create something like
this (and trust me, you don't ;-), then I wrote
  http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20031215/023510.html
which might also help.

Hello

We're in the Faculty of Education playing with Perl and RDF (amongst other 
things) and writing bespoke apps for education research projects.

Nobody here has the faintest idea what it is we do, and we're getting fed 
up only talking about Perl to each other.

Any Perlish activity about, here in 'big sky country?'

Regards

Patrick (wpc22) and Richard (rp311)

Well the Computing Service is well infested with it.
Perhaps we should have a meet.

Hi,

I'm new about here, love Perl and would be interested to get involved with
cam.pm.  :-)

By way of introduction, I'm a first year Computer Science student at the
university.  I've been doing web programming in Perl for a few years now,
and have done various other things with it too.

More recently, I've played a (small, insignificant) role in the development
of Parrot, mainly consisting of a few patches to fix stuff.  I also do the
Parrot On Win32 binary distribution, and am working on a Parrot Win32
library.  Aside from that, I lead development of AMaMP, an open source cross
platform audio engine.  This is done in C (configure script and test script
aside - which are done in Perl!), but I am going to start working on a Perl
binding soon as the engine is finally starting to become usable, and maybe
even slightly useful.

Well, that's me.  BTW, anyone planning to go to YAPC::Europe?

Later,

Jonathan

Hello all,

I'm looking at writing a backup script to replace Amanda, as Amanda is
rather inflexible. There are some very specific requirements I'm
trying to implement:

- most of the target is source checkouts in people's home directories,
  therefore consists of many, many identical small files;
- but some of the files are very large (although none over 2Gb yet)
- total area is up to about 250Gb
- we want to fit as much of that as possible onto one 20/40Gb tape
- we want users to be able to select what gets backed up, defaulting to on
- we want to identify users with disproportionate backup requirements
- maybe implement quotas on the above

I had the idea to deduplicate files on the tape by e.g. MD5sum. But I
don't know of a standard archive format that supports that. Ideally I'd
like the tape format to be reconstructable with standard tools for obvious
reasons. Failing that, I'll stick a copy of the restore script on the
front of every tape.

Anyone want to post their backup script that does anything like this? Or
want to offer advice on how to proceed?

Pete

This might help a bit with that...
http://www.t8o.org/~mca1001/cgi/viewcvs/bin/sort_revname.pl

The basic plan is to sort the list of filenames before you make the
tarball.  Put all the CVS/Root files together, all the Makefiles
together, more specifically all the fooproj/Makefiles closer than the
other ones...

It could be generally useful for repeated copies of files when they
have the same names.  For CVS working copies, maybe you could do
clever stuff to record only the differences from a clean checkout, but
this sounds like Work.

> - but some of the files are very large (although none over 2Gb yet)

Filename sorting won't help much here!  Maybe some filter between tar
and gzip that can do rolling checksums the way rsync does...

> - total area is up to about 250Gb

Do you define "much" by uncompressed size, number of files, number of
users with complete copies...?

> to on

Another filename filter then?  Configured by dotfiles per directory or
one off?

Will the users be happy with writing a ~/.backup-list.pl script which
generates the filename list for what to include?  That's the ultimate
flexibility, and trustworthy if you su per user and maybe post-filter
the output.

> - we want to identify users with disproportionate backup requirements

Quota by compressed size?  Ouch.  8-/

Especially if the files are sorted to put ~fred/cvswork/wibble.dat
right next to ~bill/cvswork/wibble.dat .

Nor me.  You could big-bodge it by pretending the identical files are
hard linked, but then there's chaos if you unpack the thing without
undoing that.

An rsync-algorithm based stream de-duper sounds quite useful.  If you
made a good one it could be a standard.  8-)

Advice not entirely from my armchair.  I hope you can find something
useful in there.

If you use userv then you could have an easy to use default
implementation which users could override.

Sorting the filename list will help here, but you'd better make sure
you're using LVM snapshots or similar.  Otherwise the backups are
likely to be quite skew and of course you'll get lots of errors which
will be hard to tell apart from real errors.

"Could" doesn't imply "will" - I think I'll keep it to a file listing
directories / files which should be backed up, probably with some sort of
include/exclude syntax, e.g.:

+/home/pete
-/home/pete/bigjunk
+/home/pete/bigjunk/longpath/important_file

I'd like to do that, but it's infeasible to switch to LVM on the relevant
system. I don't think it will be too much of a problem given that the
backup happens overnight. At the moment, we just use Amanda's tar mode.
The complication I can see is that the MD5sum must be that of the exact
data written to tape, otherwise you might restore the wrong file. Hmm, and
there are issues if users are changing either the source or restore
targets while this is going on (your reference file might have gone away).

Basically there are two cases that I want to compress specifically:
- source code checkouts: everyone is going to have *mostly* identical
files
- we have lots of VLSI design data around which consists of large,
unchanging files; any careless duplicates of those will eat a lot of space

I can't believe that there isn't software out there which addresses this,
but if there isn't then it would clearly be a useful thing to write.
afio is very close, but despite its 87 zillion commandline options it
doesn't exactly do this. I suppose I could fake it by pretending to be a
"compression" program.

Would this be better/more reliable as a block-level deduplication program
run on a tar (or other) archive of the relevant files?

Which versions of Perl are largefile-clean? Do I need to do anything
special to get largefiles to work?

All of them since 5.6.0, which was released four-ish years ago.  
Your glibc will need to support O_LARGEFILE.

   > Do I need to do anything special to get largefiles to work?

perl -V | grep USE_LARGE_FILES will tell you whether it's compiled in;
you'd need to compile with -Duselargefiles if it wasn't.  The configure
script always enables it (if the platform supports it) by default.

Here is a quick and dirty approach that assumes file with similar
contents will have similar basenames:

  * Generate the full filename list
  * Sort the filename list as follows:
    1) all directories precede all regular files
    2) directories precede their subdirectories
    3) for regular files, filenames are transformed by reversing the
       order of filename components before being sorted lexically
       (i.e. /home/pete/dir/file.c becomes file.c/dir/pete/home/)
  * Create a tarball (or whatever), and filter that through gzip or
    bzip2 (or whatever)

Making similar-content files likely to be near one another gives an
ordinary compressor more chance to take advantage of their
similarity.

Compared to your per-file de-duping it loses on files with same
content but different-enough basenames; but wins on files with similar
names and similar but not identical content (which seems like a useful
kind of thing for mostly duplicate source trees).

It probably loses on the very big files too, depending on the details
of the compression program; how significant this is will depend on how
many there are.

Compressed backups make me a little twitchy, but you're basically
proposing to compress them anyway...

Greetings, people.

Um, well, I hate to do this, but youse being local perlmongers and all,
I thought you might be somewhat approachable.

It seems that I have accepted a job in Cambridge, and will be moving
over to spread my own brand of joy to Engerland.

So, well, you know, living and all. Areas to avoid? Initially I will be
looking at a one bedroomed flat sort of gaff, until I can drag the brood
over. Which will then mean finding the postcode where all the best
schools are. Grief, how very middleclass of me.

All information gratefully received. For which in return I am willing to
donate pintage. Or pie-age, whatever floats the East-of-England boat. Or
punts the um, gondolas, being that part and all.

Oh, I should have introduced myself, shouldn't I? Hello. And yes, I
shall attend some meetings. I will be the one with the unintelligable
accent muttering about yes, real ale is good, but it isn't the black
stuff and all that...

Hi there

I have a question about Perl that I can't get answered as I can't find 
any Perl forums on the net so I was wondering if you could answer this 
for me? by the way I'm based in St.Neots.

Can I install Perl and run in on an Apple Mac computer running OSX ?

Regards.

Nigel

Yes you can. :-)

But you'll already have perl on it, installed as /usr/bin/perl by Apple.

My bad.  I have been be-thesised.  I recall Matthew Garrett volunteering
to be pub minion, though he may not have been sober at the time ;P  It
seems I'm going along to london.pm tonight, if anyone wants to join me.

If it's not too late, then CB4 seems to be where everyone else lives.  
It's within walking distance of the city centre and has a very nice real
ale pub.

Whereas I missed it for the first time in months (maybe a couple of years)
partly by being in bed (asleep - spend 16 hours solid in bed. This is good)

Then again, I saw Matthew Garrett on Thursday morning (in our living room)
so does that count as a quorate cam.pm meeting? :-)

When *is* the next cam.pm meeting? Will there be nice beer?

Nice.

Just to save me having to create a new message, and, no doubt, show that
it takes only one level of spearation to get away from the point, no
Christmas dinner/drinks? Or even mention of a meeting?

Fantastic!  Oh, I guess I should've plugged the advent calendar a week
earlier.

I am a consultant for a top ecommerce company in Cambridge.  They are in

you personally could be interested - or if you could point me in the

Well, my knowledge of central Cambridge pubs is limited, and even at
that, I am not sure of the names. (I will never, ever be persuaded to go
to the Cam Bar again, though. Having lived through the original Sisters
Of Mercy 80s phase, watching 17 year old girls in fishnets pretend is
too much. No offense if you are a 17 year old girl in fishnets, of
course. I should be quiet now, right?)

Currently frequented quite um, frequently is the Railway Tavern in Great
Shelford.

I am easy, and will go where lead. Plus, not having been here for that
long I will defer to those more knowledgable than myself. (Yup, passing
the buck.)

Splitting the memes *again*, whoa, Bill and Ted, how coincidental is
that?

It just so happens that your name, Simon, triggered a bell in meh heed.
And, lo, one of my Mozilla tabs has:

http://search.cpan.org/~simes/LJ-Simple-0.11/Simple.pm

open on it. Cool, no? Gosh etc et al ad infinitum.

*smile* I'm glad its being useful. Although I really need to improve the
docs and code the last few bits of the LJ flat protocol up. You can thank
a telco for LJ::Simple as they kept me hanging around with no work to do
for a number of months before they finally let me take VR.

Hmmm, I keep forgetting that you were part of the Tanking Telco. Bugger, I've
been hanging around Nicolai too much. :-)

Yo, people.
                                                                                                                                                           
This is annoying me. A better way please?
                                                                                                                                                           
perl -e '@l = (1..10); do { warn join(" ", @l), "\n"; unshift @l, pop
@l; } for (0 .. 10);'
                                                                                                                                                           
Which also leads me to say: Does anyone still use 'foreach'? I can't say
I have used it in yonks. I never even think of it.
                                                                                                                                                           
Oh, and 'appy Christmas.

I suppose I should have explained a bit more.

I use 'for' all the time, never 'foreach'. There isn't a difference, is
there?

perl -e '%f = map { $_ => $_ * $_ } (1 .. 10); warn $_, "\n" for keys %f;'

perl -e '%f = map { $_ => $_ * $_ } (1 .. 10); warn $_, "\n" foreach keys %f;'

Having done my training with the Tom Christiansen Perl Consultancy, I 
suppose I have been trained to use the correct way. I was told that 
whilst for and foreach are actually interchangeable because of some C 
programmers wishes, it was bad form to do so. Also, having been a 
teacher, and expecting students to do as told, rather than what they 
want, I always do as told, and so always use

for ($i = 0; $i < @array; $i++) {
	do something to $array[$i];
}

and

foreach (sort keys%hash) {
	do something to $_;
}

I suppose each to their own.

But what is the annoying part?

This might be more annoying:

perl -e '@l=(1..10)x2; warn join(" ",@l[-$_..9-$_]),"\n" for 0..10'

Thank you. Must look at the Advent calendar...

Hi again all.

Is anyone planning on doing Portugal this year? (This is the intro, not
the main point.)

I tend to only get to every other one, and having missed the one in
Belfast (and me working there at that time, too. Or not. I was
Scandanavia-locked at the time.) it seems that I might attend this year,
if I can con^H^Hcajole^H^Hobtain some money from my overlords for the
trip. Else I may fund it myself. I still haven't got to the point yet.
Here it comes...

I would like to practice the talk prior to going, and would like to
practice it to youse lot. a perlmonger group. An elusive one, mind, but
one all the same. Could I convince people, at some point undefined in
the future (and preferablly after I have written the damned thing) to
listen to me?

m.

Hi,
I'm Amedeo Guffanti,
a 22 years old  Italian student at Bocconi university in Milan,

I' m doing a research to write a work about Open Source Movement, in
particular, about the developers.

I try to collect the opinions of developers like you.

My little poll is at this page :

http://www.alberocavo.com/OSSprojects.asp

It takes less then 4 minutes.

I hope the Open Source Communities will give me a help for my research.

I apologize for taking your time and for my English that I hope it's
understandable ^^

Sincerly,
Amedeo Guffanti

Sorry to be out of touch for so long.  I've been thoroughly ensconced in
my PhD and no one else volunteered to organise.  If it hasn't escaped your
attention, there's a beer festival happening on Jesus Green.  I'll
hopefully be volunteering behind the bar all week and it would be good to
see some of you.  See http://www.cambridge-camra.org.uk/festival/

Well, I shall be along probably on Thursday eve, and maybe all day
Friday. :)

If you see a confused (my normal state) Irish type wandering around, do
say hello.

And that page is _seriously_ b0rked. I know youse desperately need more

I'm too busy and London'y to turn up. A meeting soon when I can  
actually make it would be nice though, I'll try to do my best to  
refrain from launching into a long explanation of why Java and Python  
are better really.

hi..

I am trying to send a single icmp packet with this
code : http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=488226 .

Since i have no idea why this script wont work in my
LAN, i asked ny friend (in chat) to test it, and he
said the script's working fine.

So I re-checked all lines in this code, and seems its
fine, so i remade a script (shorter than before),
here's the code:

use Socket;
socket(SOCK,PF_INET,SOCK_RAW,getprotobyname('icmp'))
|| die "Error: $! \n"; 
$msg = pack("C2 n3",8,0,32127,0,1); 
print "the value of checksum is:", unpack('H4',
pack('n',32127)), "\n"; 
print "[And you should see this in your tcpdump -i lo
icmp -xxx]\n";
send(SOCK,$msg,0,sockaddr_in(0,inet_aton('localhost')))
|| die "Error: $! \n";

As you can see, there's no subroutine to calculate
checksum, yea, because im going to try it to LOCALHOST
and as far as i know, no 'valid checksum' needed for
localhost (so i add 32127 for checksum).

I ran this script, i got the response (echo reply) and
i can see '32127' or '0x7d7f' (in hex) in tcpdump,
here's tcpdump log :

01:55:23.930771 zacko > zacko: icmp: echo request (DF)
4500 001c 0000 4000 4001 3cdf 7f00 0001
7f00 0001 0800 [7d7f] 0000 0001

everything's work normal.
let's try to change the checksum value, change all
32127 (in code above) to 32128, well i still got the
response (echo reply), but when i look closer into
tcpdump log, i feel something wrong there, there's no
32128 or '0x7d80' (in hex) , here's tcpdump log :

02:09:11.912392 zacko > zacko: icmp: echo request (DF)
4500 001d 0000 4000 4001 3cde 7f00 0001
7f00 0001 0800 [7dc2] 8000 0000 01

There's no 0x7d80 but 7dc2 (and i think 7dc2 is
32194).
If ICMP_ECHO=8, SUBCODE=0, $pid=0, and $seq=1, and
then we pass these variables to subroutine checksum,
we'll get 63486, and of course if i send icmp packet
to another host, with checksum value=63486, i'll get
no response back (as long as checksum value > 32127).

Well, i have no idea, what's going on here, by the
way, i am using Redhat Kernel 2.4.20-8, libcap version
0.7.2

I wish, i can explain this problem in better english,
i'll ask my friend to translate this question :[




thanks, zac

Greetings.

Well, it has been a while now since the last YAPC, and I did mention to
another cam.pm-er (hi Jonathan, it must be time for you to be back in
this cold place again) that I would send a mail. Offering us up to do
our talks.

But aside from that, I draw you attention to Dave's list:

http://dave.org.uk/missing/

Not hasslin', just pointing out. :)

I wondered why cam.pm hadn't responded. I know you're very quiet. But 
you're not dead are you?

I'm hassling :)

Also, the prototype of the new Perl Mongers map has you in a rather 
strange position (just north of Bristol), so it might be worth checking 
your lat and long in the Perl Mongers XML file too.

We still exist, though, with Lucy as the official contact, I don't know
how busy she's been - I gather it's been somewhat so.

Possibly it's worth her appointing a new leader.

I've been moving house and job and email address and stuff ;P  I did ask a 
while ago if anyone felt like organising anything, but nobody volunteered.

Yuss.  Any volunteers?

Yeah, I'm back for the term.  And yes, I'll give my talks if anyone wants to 
listen to them.  I can also do a Parrot talk and a basic Perl 6 one, if 
anyone would want to hear those.  I suggest, not all on the same night.  ;-)

I can make any location I can walk to from the town center, and any day 
apart from Wednesdays and Fridays.  Ah, and I'm only in Cambridge for 
another year, and only during term time anyway, so I doubt I'd be a good 
candidate for leader.  Unless you only want to meet in term time, and find 
another leader in a year's time.  :-)

Greetings.

I note one of our own is speaking at this. Which implies he is heading
that way on that day.

I was considering this (hectic schedule betwixt now and, oh, ever puts
it in *slight* doubt), but if anyone (including said speaker) is going
down, and is travelling by train, and is coming back at some point, and
would like companionship (presuming I get myself in gear to go) then I
might be up for it.

Oh dear, I must learn how to construct emithery.

Yup, I'll be heading down by train.  There's one leaving at 8:30 that gets 
us to King's Cross for 9:45 to catch the tube, which is probably about OK, 
though if we want to be there really on time then the 8:01 offers more time 
to play with.  I just hope the coffee stall at Cambridge station is open at 
those kinda times...

Thanks for posting this.  It was buried in my full inbox/To Do list.  As for

Hi,

I'm heading to London on the 8:01AM train from Cambridge station.  I'll hang 
about in the entrace to the station at about 7:55, otherwise I guess just 
find me on the train.  I look like I do on photos you'll find on my site 
(just refresh the homepage until you see one you think you'll recognize me 
by):-
http://www.jwcs.net/~jonathan/

Hopefully see some of you there,

Jonathan

It's alive! 

According to the 2005 Perl Monger census[0] we still exist, so I wondered if 
anyone would like to partake of some beer.  If no-one suggests a sensible 
evening and vaguely city-centre pub within a week, you'll get stuck with my 
choice.  Additionally, Birmingham.pm[1], with their brand-spanking new 
website, are threatening to come and invade sometime.  We can't let those 
brummies drink us under the table ;P 

In perl-related excitement, as part of my recently-promoted duties, today I 
got to parse large bits of PubMed[2] and battle with Spreadsheet::Excel. 


Glug,

Are there any vaguely sensible city centre pubs? Can I ask to avoid
Wednesday eves, as I play bridge in Witersfield that night.

Tuesday would mean I would turn up a bit later, but otherwise, I would
be happy with any night. I think. No, wait, I have a life, honest, but
workarounds always um, worked around.

Of course, if it is on a school night, and I am driving back home (not
being a city centre type) then little alcohol would be quaffed. But I
can talk forever.

And as for brum-types drinking us under the table, hah, not a mission. I
mean, they are from Birmingham. BIRM-ING-HAM.

Heh, my Perl fun today consisted of hacking the code that generates the op 
translation dispatch code for my .NET => PIR translator so it could handle 
2-byte instruction codes as well as the single byte ones.  Fun, huh...  I 
can run 100 or the 212 .NET ops on Parrot now though, which is kinda nice, 
but means there's still some way to go.

Well, it also depends if we want to eat. Baron of Beef? Hop Bine?
Baroosh? Next week?

In that case, I propose next Thursday in the Castle Inn on Castle Hill[0] 
from around 7pm (which may clash with other things, but will hopefully be 
quieter than Friday).  I'll be sitting upstairs with a toy polar bear 
(unless I can find the camel in the boxes from the house move several months 
ago).

Next Thursday, i.e. not today.  I forgot to mention that the CAMRA Winter 
Ale Festival[0] starts this evening, in case anyone else is interested.

I'm told it was busy last night but is not expected to be too full tomorrow 
day time.  Might make a nice break from the shopping trip I'm planning.

/102-5317297-3006519> 


***IP Telephony: You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet
Developers now have the right tools and the right motivation to build a wide 
range of new desktop applications, telephone services, and corporate phone 
systems that integrate voice with the Web, IM, WiFi, and more. Ed Stephenson 
talks with program cochair Surj Patel about what's emerging in telephony, 
and what you can expect to learn at O'Reilly's upcoming Emerging Telephony 
Conference.
<http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/etel/2006/01/05/ip-telephony-you-aint-seen- 
nothin-yet.html> 


***MacVoices #521: Getting the Most Out of eBay with Nancy Conner
Didn't get what you wanted for the holidays? Need to get rid of what you did 
get? Or maybe you just are looking to get a great deal on anything? Nancy 
Conner, the author of "eBay: The Missing Manual" talks about getting the 
most out of the online auction service. Tips for both novice and experienced 
users cover the many types of auctions on eBay, basic and advanced bidding 
and sales techniques and ways to protect yourself when buying and selling. 
Want to know how to snipe auctions? What all those eBay ratings mean? Nancy 
covers all this and more.

***Clone Pong, Using Only SDL (and Your Brain)
One of the great things about the games of yore is that they tended to be 
pretty simple, and as Josh Glover explains, Pong is one of the simplest to 
implement. In this first article of a three-part series, Josh shows you how 
to clone Pong all by yourself.
<http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2005/12/15/clone-pong-using-sdl.h 
tml> 

 

***Inside NetBSD's CGD
Security-minded laptop users live in fear of theft, not only of their 
computer, but also of their precious secret data. NetBSD's CGD project is a 
cryptographic virtual disk that can protect sensitive data while acting like 
a normal filesystem. Federico Biancuzzi recently interviewed its author, 
Roland Dowdeswell, on the goals and implementation of the system.
<http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/12/21/netbsd_cgd.html> 

 ---------------------
Mac
 --------------------- 

***The Power of mdfind
In addition to the little blue magnifying glass in the upper-right corner of 
your desktop, Tiger provides the mdfind and mdls commands for searching. 
Andy Lester discovered them while working on his updates to "Mac OS X Tiger 
In A Nutshell." Essentially, they provide the power of Spotlight in the Unix 
shell. Here's how it works.
<http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2006/01/04/mdfind.html> 


***Mac Users and the Macs They Use
When you read the articles and weblog posts by prominent Mac users and Mac 
pundits, do you ever find yourself wondering what kind of computer setup 
they're using? Giles Turnbull does. He recently contacted a spat of Mac 
professionals and asked them what they depend on. Here's what they had to 
say.
<http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/12/28/mac-users-and-the-macs-the 
y-use.html> 

 ---------------------
Windows/.NET
 ---------------------
***Unit Testing in Visual Studio 2005 Team System
Unit testing is one of the tasks that every programmer worth their salt 
needs to do. Wei-Meng Lee shows you how to use the new Unit Testing feature 
of Visual Studio 2005 Team System to auto-generate the code needed to test 
your application.
<http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2006/01/03/unit-testing-in-vi 
sual-studio-2005-team-system.html> 


***Just-In-Time Data Loading For DataGrids
One of Jesse Liberty's clients has a problem: she has a database with 2 
million records and wants to display these records in a data grid, but does 
not want to load them all into memory from the database. She wants them 
loaded "just in time." Jesse shows how to use the new DataGridView to neatly 
solve the problem.
<http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/12/20/just-in-time-data- 
loading-for-datagrids.html> 

 ---------------------
Java
 ---------------------
***Using Global/Distributed Transactions in Java/JDBC with Oracle Real
Application Clusters
Maintaining transaction integrity, and rolling back failed steps, becomes 
more difficult on a cluster. One option is to move some of the load 
balancing decisions to your code, and account for which cluster nodes you're 
using. Sachin Shetty shows how this works in the context of an Oracle Real 
Application Cluster.
<http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/12/21/global-distributed-transactio 
ns-with-oracle-rac.html> 


***Maven Project Reporting and Publishing, Part 1
Maven's not just about building; it's about viewing, understanding, and 
managing your projects. In this first part of a two-part excerpt from 
"Maven: A Developer's Notebook," authors Vincent Massol and Timothy M. 
O'Brien introduce Maven's reporting features for issue tracking, 
dependencies, code style, and more.
<http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/excerpt/mavenadn_ch04/index.html> 

 ---------------------
Digital Media
 ---------------------
***Introduction to Camera Raw
Adobe's Camera Raw is arguably the most popular RAW-format converter 
available today. In this video, Deke McClelland introduces you to this tool 
and shows you tips for making image adjustments.
<http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2005/12/16/camera-raw.html> 


***Andy West: From Dregs to (Software) Riches
Dixie Dregs co-founder Andy West discovered that virtuosity can be a 
liability in the music world, but a benefit in technology. Now this 
four-time Grammy nominee programs computers by day and pursues his amazing 
music at night, drawing the best from both disciplines. Here's how.

Argh!  So the one Thursday I can't make this term ('cus I'm having a party 
to celebrate my birthday), cam.pm has a meeting!  :-(

Hopefully this sparks off the first of many, so I can make the next one.

Hope it's fun,

Yes, I know of at least a few people planning on coming.  I'll head straight 
for the pub when I get off the bus and try and bag a table.  You have time 
to go home and eat first?!  *boggle*  Can I have your job ;P

*wail* No polar bear!

Ah well, nice pint, two tracks from 'Stumble into Grace', down into town
and bump into others, then home to wash my hair.

Next time, perhaps I will leave my mobile number.

We were there, and so was the polar bear, but we were downstairs 
(upstairs was full), and the polar bear was quite little. Mobile numbers 
would be a good idea, except I never have mine turned on, I shall make a 
special effort!

We shall have to try again next month. It's a hard life, ;).

If someone sorts out the venue, I'll give $talk, or maybe @talks.  What do

I think that it certainly gets that way later on in the week, but it can 
be quite dead on Monday and Tuesday. Also, quite a lot of the custom 
seems to be after work custom from the council offices, so it gets 
quiter later.

I was going to suggest earlier in the week for the next meet.  I don't know

The Carlton is quite nice (last time I was there was with the esteemed
Mr. Cozens.) If I don't go home first, I can lift one person in my car,
she only being a wee thing. If I do go home, I can take four more with
me. So if lifts were wanted, I could oblige. Though, come on, it isn't
*that* far out, is it?

No, it's my (approximate) local.  I was just being considerate to anyone who 
might live somewhere less sensible ;P

Hi Lucy & the list,

Birmingham Perl Mongers, as part of a promotion tour for the 2006
YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, are attempting to visit every UK Perl
Monger user group that holds a social or technical meeting. Having
looked at the website and the mailing list archives, I had though that
Cambridge.pm had disintegrated, but have today been reliably informed 
that you recently held a social meeting.

So do you have plans to meet on a regular basis, and if so what day of
the month are you planning to meet? With a bit of luck, and holidays
permitting, myself and hopefully a few others will try and head over to
Cambridge for an evening.

See our website for more details of the tour.

Cheers,
Barbie.

Sorry, we're a bit unorganised atm ;)  We're due a social in the next few 
weeks and possibly a tech meet soonish afterwards.  No regular meeting day 
set yet, so feel free to suggest a date ;)

I'd be interested in a date.  ;-)

I'm writing (erm, will be writing) a new Parrot talk soon to give to the 
Cambridge Programming Research Group, so you can have that if you'd like.

Aha, a sucker...I mean volunteer!  I'm still confused about Perl 6, so that 
might be an intersting talk.

OK, so maybe I do 2 shorter talks, one on Perl 6 (I've got an idea for a 
Perl 6 talk) and one on Parrot, and try to stake out how they relate to one 
another?  Or does nobody want to hear about Parrot?  Or... :-)

Main thing is, the meeting needs to be while I'm still in Cambridge.

Well, not London.  ;-)

I was more referring to the fact that term will end sometime (17th 
March-ish) and I'll be heading back home.  Home is Scarborough, which 
doesn't have a .pm group, though I'll be spending a couple of weeks in the 
south of Spain, so I guess I can always defect to Malaga.pm, apart from I'm 
not sure it exists any more...

Subject: YAPC::Europe::2006 - The Dates
Date: Tue, 28 Mar 2006 21:22:54 +0100
To: "YAPC::Europe Conferences List" <conferences@yapceurope.org>
Cc: YEF Board List <board@yapceurope.org>,
	"YAPC::Europe::2006 Organisers List" <organisers@birmingham2006.com> 

=== Announcement #2 === 

Hello, and welcome to our long anticipated second official bulletin
regarding the 2006 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference from the Birmingham 2006
Organisers. 

When signing up to host a YAPC::Europe we never expected, despite the
words of warnings from previous organisers (see Cog's final speech in
Braga), just how traumatic it could be. 

It has been unfortunate that negotiations with venues didn't go as
planned and have taken considerably longer than we had anticipated.
However, we have found a venue, so we hope this crazy mule of a
conference is finally coming under control, so please be prepared for a
plethora of announcements and updates in the coming months. It's time to
uncage the beast... 

==== The Dates ==== 

After many many requests, we can now reveal the official dates for the
conference. The conference will be held from ... 

   Wednesday 30th August to Friday 1st September 2006. 

In the UK this follows the bank holiday weekend, and is the calm before
the storm when all the students return during September. 

We are planning meetup events in a local pub in the evening for Tuesday
29th August and Saturday 2nd September, to extend the conference
experience, for anyone arriving early and/or leaving later. Details of
these will be announced nearer the time. 

==== About Birmingham ==== 

For those wondering where Birmingham is, and why they should come and
visit us, please read on. 

Birmingham is the UK's second city, located in the heart of England.
Technically speaking the village of Meriden is the centre of England,
which is located 10 miles south of Birmingham city centre, but
Birmingham has always been the commercial centre. 

Birmingham grew from humble beginnings of a group of small villages,
through the industrial focal point it became in the 1800s, to the
commercial city it is today. As a result of this Birmingham has become a
hub for road, rail and canal networks. 

There is a rich history both in Birmingham and in the West Midlands,
with towns and cities in the surrounding area providing many attractions
to keep visitors entertained. Stratford-upon-Avon, Leamington Spa,
Warwick and Ironbridge are all within easy reach of Birmingham, should
you wish to extend your stay. 

==== Contact ==== 

Should you wish to contact us, there is now an email address available
for direct contact, where you can mail us with your questions and
suggestions. The address is: 

organisers@birmingham2006.com 

There is also the regular YAPC::Europe conference mailing list, open to
all. See  http://lists.yapceurope.org/mailman/listinfo/conferences. for
more details. 

That's all for this release. Look out for more news and announcements
coming soon. 

Thanks,
The Birmingham 2006 Organisers

...is there anyone going? I shall be, again, as ever.

But in an effort to not be finishing writing my talk(s) during the talk
before I am due to talk on whatever I am talking on, it would be good to
present it prior. Thereby forcing me to write something.

I have submitted one already, but that is the sarcastic
hopefully-will-be funny one. I may even do a serious one too this year.

In summary then:

anyone else going?
do we have a meet to speak? Or a meet to drink? Now that the good
weather has returned.

Or something. I dunno.

I'm planning to submit one or two talks, and have also said to leo (of 
Parrot fame) that I'd be happy to work with him to co-present a tutorial, 
though we're not sure there would be sufficient interest.

Good weather my arse.  Unless it's somewhat better down in Cambridge than 
hear in Scarborough, of course...  I guess I shouldn't have spent the two 
weeks in Spain recently, then I'd still not remember what good weather is... 
Anyway, I'm back in Cam in a couple of weeks, so will try and make a meet 
provided it's on a night I can.

No, I haven't had time to arrange a tech meet.  Maybe this will compensate: 
http://www.cambridge-camra.org.uk/2006/cbf.html.  I'm planning to go on  
Thursday.

At this point I'll laugh insanely - I'm currently in the "Free time ? What free time ?" mode
thanks to the new job.

I'll probably not even make the beerfest on the Saturday at this rate :(

What-ho peeps.

There are some images on the cam.pm website that I would like to
nick^H^H^Huse in my talk at YAPC::Europe at the end of the month. And as
opposed to doing so unbidden, I would like to ask if whomever did them
objects, and if they tell me who they where, then there name will go on
my credits slide. 

You know the ones, the dollar_[underscore|at|qmark|star].jpg. Those
ones.

As about this time I should be thinking about my talk. Cause the
important things like asking who owns the images need done first. No
point in even thinking what I am going to say until that is sorted out.
Priorities.

Gosh, wireless in pubs is great, isn't it?

Greetings, people.

I (and someone else from The Kompany) are travelling by the train to
Brum, erm, the week after next. (Which reminds me to write my talk. Oh
dear.)

We are getting the just-after-3pm train. 1504, I think, but don't quote
me on that. Or do, if you are standing on the platform and I am on the
departing train, as then I am safe. Safe, I say, SAFE!

If you feel the urge to get said train as well, please do so. That would
be nice.

m.

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Amazon Web Services Talk 

Jeff Barr from Amazon is in town over the weekend of September the 9th
and 10th and has offered to give us a talk. We'll probably augment that
with some talks from people who've used Amazon Web Services to create
cool stuff. 

The snag, of course, is that it's a weekend so, in order to gauge
interest I ask you to add your name to 

	http://london.pm.org/aws/ 

And we'll see if we can muster enough people for either Saturday or
Sunday. 

This is open to anyone, not just London.pm so please pass far and wide. 

Thanks, 

Simon

I didn't get round to registering (slap wrist).  How was it?  I've heard 
good things.

Which pubs?  Speaking of which...we should take advantage of Grue while 
she's in the UK and meet up.  I suggest the Carlton Arms on some day to be 
arranged when I have more brain.

The beer track was great. Evil Dave, naughty man.

Oh, wait, there were talks? Summary:

Larry's keynote: meh, he has done a lot better. C-
acme's search talk: quality. Single word slides rule. B+
kane's Acme::BadExample solution: absolutely stonking. Now I know why
you would want to put coderefs in @INC.

I don't recall much else. It was so long ago now.

Hiya,

I've just got email back from davorg. He's happy to come up and even
do a talk if we want a tech meet or I'm sure he'd be just as happy to
just drink beer. A few of the other london.pmers have said they'd be
interested - we could potentially get a few speakers and have a proper
tech meet if anyone is interested.

Or we could just drink beer/wine *grin*.

What do people think?

check.

I've dealt with this recruiter before. He seems to be one of the few decent
ones. I don't know which company this is (but I'm curious to know, given that
they are paying above London non-city rates)

Bavarian Beerhouse, Old Street
To: "London. pm Announce" <london.pm-announce@london.pm.org>



A special London.pm Christmas bash just before the LPW this year -
beloved Pub Tzar Adam has manage to secure us space at The Bavarian
Beerhouse on Old Street where we can clink Mass, eat Schnitzel and
basically be merry to the rolling sounds of Oompa Music.

itch


Now the standard blurb ...

  Social meetings are a chance for people to meet up face to face for a
  quiet drink (alcoholic or not) A fair chunk of Perl is talked at the
  meetings, but also people who have no interest in the language often
  pop along to socialise.  There's no charge to enter, no agenda, and we
  tend to think of it more as pleasant drinks rather than any serious
  endeavour.

  People normally turn up after work, and many stay until closing time.
  Food is normally consumed at the pub by those wanting nourishment
  though sometimes small groups of people head off for food either
  during or after the meeting.



Description

  This is a proper Bavarian Beer Kellar - beer is served in liter or
  half liter Mass (like Steins but made from glass) by waitresses wearing
  Dirndl. The kitchen serves all sort sof traditional German food from
  snacks to main courses like Leberk=E4se (a sort of meat loaf, literally
  Liver Cheese), K=E4sesp=E4tzle (a cheesy noodle), Schnitzel and
  Schweinshaxe (pig's leg).

Location

  On City Road North of Old Street Roundabout next to the Moorfields Eye
  Hospital

By Tube

  Old Street, Barbican (0.6 miles), Moorgate (0.7 miles)

By Bus

  Lots - the 55 and 243 come from the West End and the 1, 43, 76, 141,
  205, 214 and 271 also all pass through Old Street.

You can now signup for the LPW here

And we're still looking for talks - we're especially trying to encourage
people who don't normally give talks and those who use Perl to get stuff
done in their workplaces. And BioMedics - we always like to hear from
BioMedics. 

The London Geek Bash thing seems to have run out of places so we'll
probably be finding alternative and/or additional drinking
establishments. We'll keep you posted. 

love and kisses,

Hi all,

After a prodigious amount of prodding by Nicholas about getting me to
post this to the list, the company I work for is currently looking for
"Senior Perl Developers".

If you think you might be interested (or know somebody who might be)
please feel free to pass on the following URL to them.

http://jobs.perl.org/job/5162

We're also looking for less-experienced people too (something not
mentioned on the ad) so don't hold back if you're not sure you qualify
as 'senior'.

Please feel free to email me any questions/gentle ribbing offlist.

Thanks

Chris

Hi all,

Having badgered Lucy about this, I think it's time we had a pub meet to 
discuss all the important things in life, such as how smooth and 
ergonomic Vista's UI is, the TCO benefits of the long awaited Longhorn 
server... Oh wait. Wrong list. Oops. Erm, anyway, pub meet. Let's have 
one. I've plucked a date and location out of the air, these being:

7pm, Wednesday 18th April
Salisbury Arms
76 Tenison Rd
Cambridge
CB1 2DW

http://www.salisburyarms.co.uk/

Pretty close to the station and roomy, but if anyone has any suggestions 
apropos a better venue or time, do please shout.

If you can make it, would be good to meet some fellow lunatics in the 
Cambridge area, have a beer, think about arranging a tech meet, drink 
some more beer...

Cheers,


Robbie

Kingston Arms with its free wifi? Although don't listen to me. Salisburys
Arms sounds fine. I may potter along.

Is wifi actually useful at a social meeting? Beer and laptops tend not to
mix, and surely we need to practise actually talking face to face, rather
than interacting over IRC with people we're sitting next to?

May I resurrect an idea from the excellent Mr. Clive Murray?

His cunning plan to get geeks and real people to talk to each other was 
to carry rectangular wooden frames around, so that geeks could talk 
through an IRL window.

 It's aliive!

...I was going to suggest one of the non-smoking pubs in town, in case
there are more asthmatics than me among us; however, since the time and
place of this meeting seem to already have been circulated beyond this
list, we might take over the patio (weather allowing)? (There might even
be stray wifi to be caught out there, for those who such desire.)

I suspect I am the only smoker amongst us and know the Salisbury has a decent sized non-smoking area so we can meet in there. It's also got a very high ceiling in the main area, thus ventilation is very good throughout anyway.

Colour me badgered.  Thanks for organising this, Robbie.  Hope to see you

Would anyone happen to have a spare floor I could park my sleeping bag on?
Whilst being near the station is fairly convenient for going home the same
night, not needing to return until the Thursday is far more convenient.

I have a spare bedroom 10 minutes from the pub. I'm sure we can stand the bed on end in the corner to give you enough floor space to put your sleeping bag on ;)

I hope not. Otherwise you'd never get there.
"10 minutes from the pub, max" would do me just fine :-)

Then it's not in Cambridge? But does it have pubs near it?

Hi all,

I'm new in Cambridge, a bioinformatics type working up at the Vet 
school. Since I seem to have stumbled across the website fortuitously 
close to a pub meet I'll probably turn up tomorrow (especially since you 
chose somewhere nice and close to my place). Are you lot easy to spot?

Cheers.
Roy.

A gathering of geeks is quite easy to spot, keep an eye out for laptop
bags (and laptops in use!) plus conference and computing T shirts.

Wandering round looking slightly lost and carrying a laptop bag is a good
way to get spotted.

I'm also a bioinformatics type and look forward to seeing you

We'll be in the smoke-free section, which will help you narrow us down.

Should have picked a pub with a decent outdoors section if the weather 
carries on like this, but maybe too late for a change of venue...

Or we do it like this: I know (to see, anyhow, if he remembers) Michael, and
Robbie. And Meester Clark. So there will be gravitating. And Chinese
Whispers, as each of those may know someone else, and before you know it
Kevin Bacon walks amongst us.

Or somesuch. You could cyberstalk, I guess, and print out pictures of each of
those attending, steal something from their washing line and cast foul curses
upon their progeny. But that might just be me.

Which reminds me:

I have lunch arranged in Cambridge.
I have an evening in the pub arranged in Cambridge.

What do I want to do in the bit in the middle?

Have you been away so long?

I recommend Mr Fitzwilliam's finest collection of fine old gubbins. A good
assortment of Flemish flower-and-insect paintings always on display, as are a
few Linnells and Blakes if you look closely.

Chasing punt touts up and down Bridge Street with the express intent on
beatng them to death is always fine entertainment, too.

The Sidgwick(sic) Museum of Earth Sciences is groovy, too. Kettle Yard has a
nice exhibition on, but really, why leave the pub? :)

Bring a camera and head to the Botanic Gardens, that would do it.

I like the Sedgwick <www.sedgwickmuseum.org/>  there is also the
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology near by 
<museum.archanth.cam.ac.uk/>  If you happen to have a car its worth 
knowing the IWM Duxford <duxford.iwm.org.uk/> is free after 4pm
(though on checking the site I can't find chapter and verse)

Because I need to sober up at some point early on Thursday in order to get
back to London in time for the next pub:

http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm-announce/2007-April/000086.html

Drinking lots several days in a row is not a good plan, particularly when it's
summer. (Although next week, once autumn starts, it will probably be less bad)

I was planning on leaving the car in London. Parking is hassle; beer and
petrol don't mix. [Although I suspect that petrol and cheap blended whisky
might as well mix :-) Would it work?]

Hire a bike and go for a cycle.

Or get a good book, sit on Midsummer Common, and enjoy the sunshine.

CB1 is as good a place to while away the hours as any:

A reminder to come along a drink beer/OJ/beverage of choice and talk about 
life, love and Perl.  Look out for the penguin (as my camel has gone 
walkabout).

Hey, was good to see such a good turn out on Wednesday. We ought to 
arrange another one for next month, but somewhere with a good garden 
this time.

A quick question apropos online backups: have been looking for an 
alternative to XDrive for a Mac user friend. Found lots of services for 
Windows (Mozy and Carbonite seem to be best for that) but not Mac/Linux.
Needs to be a fire and forget set up for a non-geek user. Any suggestions?

Ta

Robbie

I've been trying out Omnidrive (they have a OS X client but it's still
in beta) and it seems to work quite well...

If it's more backups that are required, then I've also used
backuptotheweb with some success...

The Blue?  I'm sure there are others.

I would prefer a non-Wednesday day.  No doubt everyone has different
days to avoid.  8-}

I've just set Dad's Linux box up with dirvish.  It's Perl </obperl>
and rsync.  It keeps multiple copies of the source filesystems and
uses hardlinks to economise on unchanged files.

He's only dumping to another disk in the machine, but with the magic
of ssh authorisation key pairs you can send it...  somewhere else, if
there is anywhere.

But not if rsync can't cope with the UFS+ filesystem?

> Found lots of services for Windows (Mozy [...]

...so I picked on Mozy to see what's out there these days.

"448-bit Blowfish encryption" and "Public or private key encryption"
are phrases from their website that ring alarm bells for me.

Do people really want closed software copying their data back to some
random company?  It doesn't seem like the best idea.


Not that Dirvish looks particularly easy to fit with encrypted storage
that can't be peeked on the archiving side.  Sigh.

I have no Windows boxes at the moment so it's all rather academic for
me.  I use a mixture of Unison and (tar | bzip2 | gpg > DVD) for my
backups, but it's all rather slaphazard.

rsnapshot is better, if only because I'll bribe you to use it with beer :-)

You mean HFS+ (as does the author of the message whose URL I deleted). 
Plain ol' rsync works just fine provided that you don't care about those 
stupid fork things.  Thankfully, OS X avoids using them to a great 
extent - even Apple finally realised that they were a really dumb idea. 
  Certainly ignoring them has never done me any harm in my backups 
(admittedly I mostly use UFS, which eschews such stupidity).

There are hacked-up versions of rsync which add support for them.  And 
another reason to use rsnapshot - I have an email in my mailbox from one 
of the lovely users who has written up in detail how to use it to back 
up Macs, which I'll be adding to the docs soon.

Consider Box Backup or duplicity if you need encryption:
   http://www.fluffy.co.uk/boxbackup/
   http://duplicity.nongnu.org/

Both have more features than dirvish or rsnapshot, but at the expense of 
making it a little more complicated to restore data.

Always a devil to get this sort of thing right. Fridays are normally a 
Bad Idea; Thursdays sometimes also for some people. Maybe rotate the day 
of the week each month (Monday-Friday) so the 3rd Thursday of the month 
next month, 3rd Friday of June &c. That would please all of the people 
all of the time...

It's not ideal, but it's infinitely better than what 99% of normal users 
have, e.g. no backup regime at all. If I never have to explain to 
someone that they lost all their emails because of a hard disk failure / 
that they should use IMAP / have backups it'll be a good thing.

Looks like there's a gap that needs filling: open automated offsite 
backups. I'll add that to my 
things-that-would-be-great-to-do-but-I-never-will list.

Hi David,

Thanks for finding a test failure in Test::Unit.  I tried to mail you
but my message bounced (munged detail below), so I'm slightly abusing
the list.

Sorry, list.  At least it has obperl.  While I'm here, why doesn't the
cpantesters thingie give me "make test TEST_VERBOSE=1", or at least
the first hundred lines of?  Even if I knew which test #29 is, which I
probably should, I'm hardly going to be able to guess the diagnostic
text that goes with it.  8-(

I haven't checked which #29 is, I'm guessing it's the hideous
is_numeric issue again.

Any chance you could send me a "make test TEST_VERBOSE=1" please?  I'm
not certain I will be able to run the tests in the same order...
which may be considered another bug, but I'll worry about that another
time.

Whilst the selection of beer was good, and the room was nice, I felt that the
food choice was only passable. Maybe I've got fussy or spoiled. Then again,
the thing that Rachel had (garlic mushroom buttie IIRC) did look far more
exciting than the uninspired lasagne I had.

Whatever, it was food.

And if you go for a good garden it will only rain. :-)

I propose The Castle Inn for the next meet, having sampled the Castle 
Burger and ales this week. That's it's walking distance from work is a

Upstairs sounds like a good bet if it's not crowded out. The location's
certainly good for me.

IME the Castle Inn is too busy and doesn't have a big enough bar to
be able to serve customers fast enough. Annoying place.

On http://www.pm.org/groups/map.html we seem to be somewhere just south of
Birmingham. The co-ordinates would seem to be those of Cambridge,
Gloucestershire. Unless there's another perlmongers lot that I wasn't
aware of, or I'm just lost.

There's Cambridge USA but cam.pm should be in the Fens as you suspected, 
quite rightly. Talking of cam.pm, let's have another social, and let's 
arrange a tech talk too. Failing there being any consensus on when and 
where, I've plucked these details out of the air for the social:

When: Thursday 28th April, 6pm onwards
Where: Osborne Arms, 108 Hills Road, CB1 1LQ
<http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?postcode2map?code=CB2+1LQ&title=Osborne+Arms>Why: 
apparently it serves Thai food, has a beer garden, gets decent reviews 
(http://www.cambridge-pubs.co.uk/) and even has parking, and if no-one 
can make it at least I can have a decent Thai meal on my tod ;)

It sort of matches up

The location is adrift in space by by 100 miles.
cam.pm.org is adrift in time by 4 years.

Does anyone know who has the keys for the site?

Do you mean 28th April? Seems a while to wait.

Damn this Gregorian calender malarky. June is probably more realistic. Why I wrote April I really do not know.

Hi all,

Sorry to abuse the mailing list by talking about Perl, but I made a 
vaguely entertaining discovery the other day. I was writing a one-liner 
to print out lines from a tab-delimited file which had a last field of 
less than 0. Obviously I wanted to write something like:

perl -ne '@a=split /\t/, $_; print if $a[-1]<0' myfile

but because it was a Friday and my brain was firmly in neutral I managed 
to type this instead:

perl -ne '$a=split /\t/, $_; print if $_[-1]<0' myfile

Weird thing was, one typo cancelled out the other and it still worked. 
Took me a fair amount of trawling through perldoc to work out why.

Anyway, ignore me, back to talking about pubs. Osborne Arms sounds good 
to me.

Roy.

Ugh, the only time I've been there it looked like a total dive and they
weren't serving food that evening. Beer selection looked below par. I
get the impression it has gone down-hill since 2003-2004 when the good
reviews were written.

That's bad news. I'll give it a look-see this week to see what it's 
like. Got any alternatives that serve food, have good beer and a garden?

The Carlton Arms.  http://www.thecarltonarms.co.uk/

Also non-smoking inside and on the citi 1 bus route from the station. 
Quiz night on Wednesdays, gets quite crowded with geeks already on a 
Thursday.  They're having a mini beer festival Tues 26 June - Sat 1st 
July.

I suppose that having it on irc.perl.org is sane, but we could always run
it on cam.pm.org, instead. :-P

He's working on the time machine first so he can get the teleport done
sooner.

There is a module on CPAN which shall remain unnamed for now. I use this
module quite heavily, and happened to discover a bug in it. Like a good
boy, I wrote a failing test for the bug and came up with a patch against
the module.  The module's POD gives an email address to send bug reports
to, so I sent the test, the patch, and a note of explanation to that
address.  That was about a fortnight ago, and I've not heard back.

I'd like some advice on what to do next. Should I give in and just keep
the fix to myself? Should I try to find another way of contacting the
author? Should I write a bad review on cpanratings? Should I distribute
the patch on my website and hope people find it? Should I upload a
rival module to CPAN? I'm curious to know what other people have done
about this.

Is it possible to add an RT bug report via CPAN? The problem is often 
that address published by CPAN gets spammed to death so the author may 
not have seen your email at all (closed the account, left it for dead?).

He might be on holiday.  Give him *at least* a month before assuming
something is wrong.

Apply the fix locally, post it to rt.cpan so that other people can
benefit.

Yes.

No.  Failure to respond to an email in a short period of time is not
something that you should criticise in someone who is giving you their
stuff for free.

No.

I'd prod the guy after a month, and again a month later, and a month
after that, and if he's still not responded I'd mumble at the modules
mailing list and ask someone with the necessary privs to make me a
co-maintainer so I can upload a fixed version to the CPAN.

That's basically what I did with Data::Compare.

Been a bit quiet on this owing mainly to having forgotten about it, but it's still on: we have Tom coming over from Milton Keynes for those of you that know him which should be reason enough to turn up ;)

Venue will be the Wrestlers Inn. Good Thai food. Easy to get to. Good company (and me).

http://www.wrestlers.co.uk/

Come. Enjoy!

Sorry about lack of Cam.pm recently.  All the organisation part of my brain 
has been geared towards my wedding last week ;)  The students come back 
soon, so I suggest a pub meet-up at some point. 

Also, I was wondering if anyone had any good/bad experience with Google 
AdWords? 


Cheers,
L.

hurrah (on the pub), not-so on the students. Although, they do displace the
tourists (and punt touts) somewhat, so a semi-hurrah then.

I made $1.58 in my first two weeks, and now I own the company! Or something.
Easy to set up (although they won't appear on my fundingterrorism.com site,
alas. What is a boy to do?) and easy to keep an eye on.

I even know people who have taken cash from the evil empire #2.

Not personally, but I remember hearing a while back about several
webmasters, including a columnist for one of the big dailies, having
their accounts cut off and outstanding payments cancelled for alleged
fraudulent behaviour. It looks like the programme has been hit a lot by
fraudsters who generate false clicks on their competitors' ads in order
to make said competitors pay more money, and Google has been a bit
heavy-handed in response.

Perhaps predictably, Google won't find me a reference now. But it must
be true, it happened the year before I came up! :->

I had it on my webshite for a coupla months, and ditched it when it got
too annoying - it didn't generate anything like enough dosh to make up
for the square inches it ate.  On the other hand, it does occasionally
provide amusement:

Congratulations! But where were our invites, hmm? ;)

Yay!

I've had limited experience as a seller. They work and are easy to set 
up but if your site isn't high volume then getting payouts can take 
forever waiting to reach the minimum payout level. As a buyer, they are 
also easy to set up and can generate a lot of traffic, but can also be 
real pricey. Overall, pretty balanced.

Out of curiousity, the company I work for in Cambridge is looking for
decent programmers who know perl. The pay (as well as the atmosphere)
is good, and whilst there are Certain Crappy Aspects (there almost
certainly always are), we generally have a great time and enjoy
ourselves for the most part.

The job is in the financial sector (not to worry, my background is
chemogenomics) and is comparatively well-paid.

Is anyone (even remotely) interested? I'm happy to chat with anyone
approaching me regarding the role if that'd help.

Please accept my apologies for spamming the list -- I've been avoiding
doing so for months,

Thanks

Hi all, 

It's about time we got together to talk Perl and beer again.  So in the 
absence of any other murmurings I declare there will be a social meet on 
Tuesday 20th November at the Carlton Arms (www.thecarltonarms.co.uk) in 
Arbury from 7pm ish. 

In other news, the BBC have claimed that the BBC websites only have 400-600 
GNU/Linux users, which sounds suspiciously low.  Read more about it at 
http://community.livejournal.com/debian/329016.html 


Cheers,
Lucy

Just a quick note to say (very sheepishly as I didn't get round to plugging 
this at the time) that the results of the Perl Survey are out.  Where are 
all the female PerlMongers?  See here: http://perlsurvey.org/results/ 

Hope to see some of you at the social next Tuesday (Carlton Arms, 7pm ish). 


Cheers,
Lucy

Just a reminder that there's a social meet this evening (Tuesday 20th) in 
the Carlton Arms (www.thecarltonarms.co.uk) from 7pm ish.  We plan on being 
in the lounge bar (on the left hand side) and there'll be a purple frog on 
the table. 

In the meantime, you can join us in #cam.pm on irc.perl.org. 


Cheers,
Lucy

Thanks for the social, L. Good to catch up with you. I *think* we agreed 
to set up a technical talk early in the new year. We have offers from 
several people to give talks, but the more the merrier. They can be on 
anything about Perl, complex or simple, and how you use it, and be it 5 
minutes or an hour, all contributions welcome!

How would doing a Saturday fit with people? Could fit it around lunch, 
so no hurrying from work to get there and no early morning starts.

TTFN



Robbie

PS Lucy, don't forget the web site - we ought to get that updated.

Greetings folks,

I'm an Australian-type traveller setting into Cambridge. I've been involved
with the Melbourne perl-mongers for some years now and thought I'd pop my
head into the local perl mongers list and say hello.

I'll keep my eye out for the next meeting and hopefully will drop in to say
'ello in person.

I'm looking for work in Cambridge so if there's any good places to look for
perl work I'd be most grateful to be pointed in the right direction. :)

Cheerio,

 Brad

Some employers in the area that use perl;

http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
http://www.booking.com/
http://www.netbanx.com/

There's always jobs.perl.org of course.

Good luck!

For the past few years, Google have run an annual "Summer of Code".
Last year, Perl missed out on the opportunity to have Google pay for
students to work on interesting code.  If you'd like to get involved
with making things happen this year, read the message below.

Subject: [pm_groups] Summer of Code -- volunteers needed

Hi all,

Volunteer pledge drive!  Please forward this to your local PM groups.

TPF needs volunteers to make summer of code happen this year.  It sounds 
like the administrators got stretched too thin in 2005 and 2006, and we 
really didn't have ourselves together in 2007.  So, I'm proposing a 
departmental structure under a TPF umbrella, which will localize the 
cat-herding effects within various large projects (so far, parrot and 
Catalyst appear to be on board with this.)  I would like to demonstrate 
that we have our act together this year, so we need to get a solid pool 
of administrative volunteers and mentors together before the 8th.


Administrative needs:

  (Contact ewilhelm@cpan.org or join #soc on irc.perl.org.)

  * backup administrator (reduce the bus number)

  * Department heads for p5p, "modules", etc

  * Suggestions about department structure


Mentors and project ideas needed:

We need to get these pages populated before March 8th or it is quite 
likely to be a no-go.
  
Potential mentors, please add yourselves and your project ideas here:

  http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?gsoc2008_mentors
  http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?gsoc2008_projects


If you hate wikis as much as I do, please visit this handy form and I 
will batch the wiki edits on your behalf.

Thanks,

interest if you are into things Semantic Webby.

I will hopefully be going. I'm quite excited - I haven't been to
Denmark since I was 10.

I'm starting a job at Netbanx in Cambridge a week today, so I have to move
to Cambridge, and find somewhere to live.

This would all be easy enough, except my girlfriend (Andrea) doesn't move
over from Austria until the end of June, and I don't think that it's
feasible to choose somewhere to rent together until she arrives.

So I was wondering if anyone has a double room that I could rent for 6-8
weeks, until we are able to find somewhere long term. Robbie Bow has kindly
offered me the use of his spare room initially, so I won't be out on the
street on Monday night, but it's only a single room, so not going to work
once there are two of us.

So does anyone have a double room, or know of someone who has one, that is
available to rent for June and July?

Nicholas Clark

Hi folks, 

Can anyone recommend a perl module for parsing Excel files?  There are too 
many to choose from!  Only needs to do basic stuff... 

 

Cheers,
Lucy

Free Perl Course Project

  The idea in this project is that every Perl programmer teach at least 
one other person to code. Be that a family member, friend, work 
colleague, employee, friend of a friend, or even friend of an employee.

Following the success of the Free Perl Course offered by Bristol & Bath 
Perl Mongers this project has been started to encourage other Perl 
groups and programmers to do the same.

Please check out the site:-
http://www.perlproject.org


P.S. Apologies for this series of cross group posts

Perl Certified Hosting

  The idea for this project was put forth by Amias of Bristol & Bath 
Perl Mongers. We are creating a Perl Certified Hosting scheme that will 
be open for all hosting companies to join.

Requirements will include a set list of web related Perl Modules and 
proper webserver configuration.

Please visit the site:-
http://www.perlcertifiedhosting.com

For more details and to get involved with helping this scheme become a 
reality.

Hello

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a technical talk? We've had
offers of talks from a fair few people, which is good because it would save
you from one of my talks which are, frankly, rubbish. Also does anyone would
have a venue for such a talk? I'm guessing evenings are probably best.

Cheers



Robbie

I really don't have anything I want to talk about. Well, in the "present"
sense.

But a social would be good.

Anyone fancy meeting up for a few drinks and the like? I'm thinking
the evening of Tuesday 24th Feb (last Tuesday of the month) and either
The Carlton Arms or the Castle Inn.

Good idea?

In general "yes" but please avoid the last Tuesday of the month
because another Perl Mongers group meets then, causing problems for
those of us with dual (or treble, or whatever) nationality.

I'm trying to revive the group site with the help of Lucy. I've
scraped most of the content (bar some of the mail archive) to my
server and requested the cam.pm.org DNS entry be changed to point at
it. If anyone wants to help maintain it / has any suggestions for what
would be useful to put on it &c. then please do fire away.

For now, the copy can be seen at http://riotprrrl.com

Cheers

One small suggestion - include a link to the Open Guide to Cambridge?
It is, after all, written entirely in Perl, and it's about Cambridge!
  http://cambridge.openguides.org/

Could even link to the individual pub pages if you're going to name
specific pubs to meet in.

Oh, actually I have two suggestions.  The other one is to see what
neat things you can steal from other Perlmongers' sites.  For example,
http://london.pm.org/ has book reviews written by members, a "who's
who" page, an opt-in list of local companies which use Perl, and an
iCal feed for meeting dates.

You know, a talk on open guides would be good. I hacked on it a *long*  
time ago, and must look again, and indeed how it integrates with open  
street maps and the who mapping community.

Good ideas. I'll add them to the list. Am thinking of a new site

Ummm... wouldn't it have been easier just to have asked for a copy of
the source? At least three people on this list have access to it :-)

That particular first Tuesday probably doesn't work for me, as I suspect
that there's a release at work that day. But releases are a movable feast,
so shouldn't affect the general planning. Plus I don't consider myself to

Well let's say 3rd March, The Carlton Arms, 7ish. That release is
probably my call so providing I have a nap in the afternoon I'll be
ready for convivial beers and chatter by 7pm, and you'll not have
suffered in the ungodly hours anyway :)

By virtue of me being a bit dopey and quick off the mark, it's likely
this mailing list will stop working very shortly (depending on whether
or not MX records have been updated as well as the A record).

The pm.org chaps are kindly going to host a new one, which should be
ready soon, so please keep an eye on
http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo for cam.pm appearing as one of the
lists there and please sign up to the new list.

Cheers and apologies for the inconvenience.

Can we solve that by exporting the old subscription list, and giving it to
them?

Am hoping we can. If anyone has admin access to the old list we could
copy the member list from there and send invites direct from the new
list.

http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/cam-pm is now ready, btw. And
#cam.pm on irc.perl.org is back again :)

Happy to help out with the site, mailing list, anything really. :)

In the spirit of the times we could push the site source up to github for
ease of collaboration. Happy to help with that too... :)

Sounds good to me - no having used GIT myself, any help appreciated.
Will pm you about that.
