The problem with that approach is that it makes code maintenance
significantly more of an issue.  You can't trivially examine data in the
perl debugger any more.

Speed is not the paramount consideration.  However, that doesn't mean
that it isn't a consideration at all...

As it happens, quite a lot of this perl code is to take data out of
various database sources (ACeDB, Sybase), munge it in various ways,
munge it with external programs in various other ways, and put the
results back into ACeDB/Sybase.  Quite a lot of this code will soon be
replaced with Java procedures within the Sybase server itself.

Tim.
