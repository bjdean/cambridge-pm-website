I just don't feel one should be expected to do extensive research into
the next stage of development of a project before installing the current
one.  If it's supposed to be obvious that we should test the development
version now then they should damned well say so rather than relying on
random word of mouth.

Sorry if I was sounding stroppy, I'm not really, more bemused.

&lt;Hollow laugh&gt; The default perl is still 4.  Do you think they're really
going to care if the next version along works with their old scripts or
not?  They'll just keep on using their old perl with them.  We don't use
them for anything mission critical or public facing or anything.  And
they're employing me because they're too busy with day-to-day stuff to
upgrade *anything*.  Perl is not a high priority.

This upgrade I'm doing is only to save me the trouble of having to
continue to try workarounds for things in my copy of the Camel book and
in my head which don't exist yet as far as their system is concerned.

I understand why you would like me to do this, but it just ain't going
to happen.  I still don't have the free disk space on the non-critical
machines to finish the current install.
