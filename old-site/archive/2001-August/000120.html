<PRE> 
&gt;<i> * I think I can safely say the social on Friday night was a success.
</I>&gt;<i> About 20 people in total turned up - including many non-subscribers who
</I>&gt;<i> we managed to twist the arms of - and we crammed into the top floor of the
</I>&gt;<i> Castle between 2 other reserved tables (might try that trick for next
</I>&gt;<i> time).
</I>
  Any thoughts on how regularly we want to do this, and/or preferences as to
what day of the week ? I like Wednesdays myself.
   
&gt;<i> Incidentally,
</I>&gt;<i> reports from my spies at the Genome Informatics meeting at Hinxton say
</I>&gt;<i> Randal talked about how perl 6 development has been organised and that
</I>they
&gt;<i> were going to change everything and get it done in 2 years.
</I>
  But.. stem cell work and human cloning are illegal in the US, they _can't_
make enough Damians to do it that quickly.

&gt;<i>  I can't remember the details of the rest due to people buying me beer.
</I>
  And crepes.  That's one of the advantages to being a Fearless Leader.

                                                     E
