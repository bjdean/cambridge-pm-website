<PRE> &gt; I would prefer a non-Wednesday day.  No doubt everyone has different
 &gt; days to avoid.  8-}

Always a devil to get this sort of thing right. Fridays are normally a 
Bad Idea; Thursdays sometimes also for some people. Maybe rotate the day 
of the week each month (Monday-Friday) so the 3rd Thursday of the month 
next month, 3rd Friday of June &amp;c. That would please all of the people 
all of the time...

 &gt; Do people really want closed software copying their data back to some
 &gt; random company?  It doesn't seem like the best idea.

It's not ideal, but it's infinitely better than what 99% of normal users 
have, e.g. no backup regime at all. If I never have to explain to 
someone that they lost all their emails because of a hard disk failure / 
that they should use IMAP / have backups it'll be a good thing.

Looks like there's a gap that needs filling: open automated offsite 
backups. I'll add that to my 
things-that-would-be-great-to-do-but-I-never-will list.
