 The meetings that took place in cam.pm's first year, 2001.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#20011116">Friday 2001-11-16</a></li>
 <li><a href="#20011012">Friday 2001-10-12</a></li>
 <li><a href="#20010905">Wednesday 2001-09-05</a></li>
 <li><a href="#20010810">Friday 2001-08-10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
These very brief summaries generally written by <a href="mailto:pak21-campm@srcf.ucam.org">Philip Kendall</a>, unless otherwise stated. Any complaints, corrections, etc to me...
</p>
<p>
 <b><a name="20011116">Friday 2001-11-16</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Not particularly well attended, but that may well be a function of it
being announced about 3 days beforehand at the bottom of a thread on
something completely different; also not helped by Ian Phillips not
being able to recognise us in the Castle.  We'll have to look more
geeky next time <tt>:-)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Followed the usual pattern of food, beer and other substances in the
Castle, followed by a trip back to House! for coffee (and toast and
mushrooms).
</p>
<p>
Most notable quote of the evening was from the late arriving MBM: "Oh,
<i>you're</i> Becky Corlett!"
</p>

<p>
Another social meet in the Castle; this time we were graced with the
presence of both Simon Cozens and some of <a
href="http://london.pm.org/">london.pm</a>. Unfortunately, none of our
lot wrote a meet report, so we'll have to make do with <a
href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20011015/006044.html">one
stolen from london.pm</a> and <a
href="http://husk.org/pics/x/browse/people/cam.pm_and_after_2002-10-12">these
photos</a> from Paul Mison.

 <b><a name="20010905">Wednesday 2001-09-05</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Our second social meet, again in the Castle. This time no famous Perl
personalities, but a brief summary would be that we turned up in the
Castle, we drank beer (and related substances), we went to House!,
people spodded until Tony stopped people spodding by pulling the ADSL
line out of the wall, people went to home/bed (I presume).
</p>
<p>
Notable moments:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>"I got run over by a car, but didn't even ladder my tights"
     (Eleanor Blair)</li>
 <li>"I like dipping into the onion" (Tony Finch)</li>
 <li>Tony making a comment about MBM which caused Sue to attempt the
     nasal insertion of her Guinness.</li>
 <li><a href="meets/camels.jpg">Tabloid newspaper headlines</a>.</li>
 <li>The summoning of various people by the mentioning of their name (Martin
     Cooper and Ian Jackson)</li>
 <li>Ian's three `R's: routing, routing, and something I've forgotten. It was
     funny at the time, OK?</li>
 <li>Sue attempting the nasal insertion of her coffee at House!</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
Our very first social meet was graced with the presence of <a
href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/">Randal L. Schwartz</a>,
author of the Llama book (<a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl3/">Learning Perl</a>,
O'Reilly Press). Highlights, mostly cribbed from Lucy's <a
href="/archive/2001-August/000119.html">report to the list</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I think I can safely say the social on Friday night was a success.
    About 20 people in total turned up - including many non-subscribers
    who we managed to twist the arms of - and we crammed into the top
    floor of the Castle between 2 other reserved tables (might try that
    trick for next time).</li>
<li>Lucy talked about her <a href="meets/cactus.jpg">cactus</a>.</li>
<li>Randal was safely delivered into our company by my boss's boss
    (hence my boss's cross-examination of me this morning) at around 9.30.
    Incidentally, reports from my spies at the Genome Informatics meeting
    at Hinxton say Randal talked about how perl 6 development has been
    organised and that they were going to change everything and get it
    done in 2 years.</li>
<li>When MBM let him get a word in edgeways, Randal gave us a slide
    show from his Stonehenge trip on Thursday, we all signed a <a
    href="meets/beermat.jpg">random bit of paper</a> (for lack of beer
    mats) and he promised to come back in November. Possibly. I can't
    remember the details of the rest due to people buying me beer.</li>
</ul>
