Which version of Perl are you using? I seem to remember that the version
of Getopt::Std whch fills in a hash is a relatively new thing (one of the
5.005 series perhaps).

And if you can't use &quot;our&quot; because you're not using 5,6.x, then the 
alternative is to use &quot;use vars&quot; to predeclare your package variables.

use vars qw($a $set %of @variables);

&gt;<i> Is there a better module out there?  Or am I just going to have to carry

</I>&gt;<i> myself?  I mean it's only half a dozen options, it shouldn't be too hard
</I>&gt;<i> to do.
</I>
Well there's Getopt::Long - but that's more complicated.

Perhaps you should just download and install a more up to date version
of Getopt::Std.
