It only makes them more readable.  They're still an abomination.  $/ and
$$ are about the only ones I ever use, although I have had occasion to use $,
and $&gt;, as in snippets like the following:

  ($user, undef, $uid, undef) = getpwuid($&gt;);

  unless (scalar(grep(/$user/<A HREF="mailto:,@Gap4">,@Gap4</A>::Cfg::rebuild_users)) &gt; 0) {
    die &quot;You do not have permission to run this program - Contact Tim.\n&quot;;
  }

Oops.  I've just spotted a bug in that.  The regexp should be /^$user$/.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Ok, so how do I get a global variable when I need one then?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just give its complete name including namespace, so:

If you say so.  :-)

$_ has all sorts of horrible magic associated with it though, doesn't it?
Things like foreach automatically localize it, for example.  I'm not
surprised if it behaves oddly in other contexts as well.  It's another
thing I avoid using apart from in very small inner loops, where it's
obvious what sort of thing $_ is.

Tim.
