<PRE>...is there anyone going? I shall be, again, as ever.

But in an effort to not be finishing writing my talk(s) during the talk
before I am due to talk on whatever I am talking on, it would be good to
present it prior. Thereby forcing me to write something.

I have submitted one already, but that is the sarcastic
hopefully-will-be funny one. I may even do a serious one too this year.

In summary then:

anyone else going?
do we have a meet to speak? Or a meet to drink? Now that the good
weather has returned.

Or something. I dunno.
