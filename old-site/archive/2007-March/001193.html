<PRE>Hi all,

Having badgered Lucy about this, I think it's time we had a pub meet to 
discuss all the important things in life, such as how smooth and 
ergonomic Vista's UI is, the TCO benefits of the long awaited Longhorn 
server... Oh wait. Wrong list. Oops. Erm, anyway, pub meet. Let's have 
one. I've plucked a date and location out of the air, these being:

7pm, Wednesday 18th April
Salisbury Arms
76 Tenison Rd
Cambridge
CB1 2DW

<A HREF="http://www.salisburyarms.co.uk/">http://www.salisburyarms.co.uk/</A>

Pretty close to the station and roomy, but if anyone has any suggestions 
apropos a better venue or time, do please shout.

If you can make it, would be good to meet some fellow lunatics in the 
Cambridge area, have a beer, think about arranging a tech meet, drink 
some more beer...

Cheers,


Robbie

</PRE>
