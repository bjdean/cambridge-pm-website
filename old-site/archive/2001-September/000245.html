It probably makes it easier to fit into my hectic (cough) social life...

I'm vaguely curious as to how much effort and money it's worth putting 
into something in order to slightly reduce my overall workload. I suppose 
that I could just outsource my entire PhD to someone in India and devote 
my time to appearing in NTK more often.

On topic, though - I've never used Perl for any terribly serious
scientific apps, so have absolutely no idea how useful it is for
performing reasonably computationally heavy tasks. The program in question
is effectively picking random numbers, doing lookups in a table based on 
those and then picking another random number to see whether what it's got 
out of the table actually happens or not. If it does, it does weird shit 
(tm) to an array and then goes back to step 1. The configuration file 
parsing currently seems to be a nightmare and would probably be reason 
enough to reimplement things from scratch, but it already takes upwards of 
12 hours for some runs and I don't really want to find that becoming 
significantly larger. Is this sort of thing feasible?
