Including those people who voted for Wednesday.  *checks secret archive*
I hereby announce the next meet to be Friday 5th October, which should
give non-Cam people a chance to comce and crash and hang around for any
weekend parties.

I like my tabloids!

Routing, routing and reading.  If anyone doesn't get the joke (I didn't
the first time), 'ooting' is apparently Aussie for having sex.

Could be worse.  Could be sherbert.


A poll.  In January which one should I go to?
* the Perl Whirl geekcruise, round the Caribbean - www.geekcruises.com
* the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Hawaii - psb.stanford.edu
* O'Reilly's bioinformatics conference, Arizona - conferences.oreilly.com

And Stephen, what kind of probabilist are you?  I may need your help.
