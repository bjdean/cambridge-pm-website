A special London.pm Christmas bash just before the LPW this year -
beloved Pub Tzar Adam has manage to secure us space at The Bavarian
Beerhouse on Old Street where we can clink Mass, eat Schnitzel and
basically be merry to the rolling sounds of Oompa Music.

Now the standard blurb ...

  Social meetings are a chance for people to meet up face to face for a
  quiet drink (alcoholic or not) A fair chunk of Perl is talked at the
  meetings, but also people who have no interest in the language often
  pop along to socialise.  There's no charge to enter, no agenda, and we
  tend to think of it more as pleasant drinks rather than any serious
  endeavour.

  People normally turn up after work, and many stay until closing time.
  Food is normally consumed at the pub by those wanting nourishment
  though sometimes small groups of people head off for food either
  during or after the meeting.



Description

  This is a proper Bavarian Beer Kellar - beer is served in liter or
  half liter Mass (like Steins but made from glass) by waitresses wearing
  Dirndl. The kitchen serves all sort sof traditional German food from
  snacks to main courses like Leberk&#228;se (a sort of meat loaf, literally
  Liver Cheese), K&#228;sesp&#228;tzle (a cheesy noodle), Schnitzel and
  Schweinshaxe (pig's leg).

Location

  On City Road North of Old Street Roundabout next to the Moorfields Eye
  Hospital

By Tube

  Old Street, Barbican (0.6 miles), Moorgate (0.7 miles)

By Bus

  Lots - the 55 and 243 come from the West End and the 1, 43, 76, 141,
  205, 214 and 271 also all pass through Old Street.
