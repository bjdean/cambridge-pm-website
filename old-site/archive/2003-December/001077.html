For added fun, my /usr/share/dict/words (from dictionaries-common on
Debian unstable) also contains lots of apostrophes and also various
accented characters.

Debian stable's contains a few hyphens as well as &quot;Modula-2&quot; and
&quot;Modula-3&quot;, and FreeBSD's has &quot;Jean-Pierre&quot; and &quot;Jean-Christophe&quot;.

Perhaps the easiest would be to reject any words containing something
outside [a-z]?

Cheers,

Phil
