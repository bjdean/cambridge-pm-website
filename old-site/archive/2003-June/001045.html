perldiag(1):

       %s() called too early to check prototype
           (W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype
           before the parser saw a definition or declaration for it,
           and Perl could not check that the call conforms to the pro-
           totype.  You need to either add an early prototype declara-
           tion for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine
           definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype check-
           ing.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling
           the function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the
           name to avoid the warning.  See perlsub.

Alternatively you can dump the error message into splain(1).

&gt;<i> 3. Why oh why oh why oh why do the Perl maintainers keep pulling shit

</I>
It's an extra optional warning. I don't see how adding extra optional
warnings for dubious constructs (in this case functions with prototypes
that aren't being checked; presumably if you added a prototype then you
wanted it to be checked rather than silently ignored?) counts as broken.

&gt;<i> For now I've grepped for all the function definitions in the script,
</I>&gt;<i> turned them into declarations, and stuck them all in a big list near
</I>&gt;<i> the top of the script.  This has bad the symptoms go away but is quite
</I>&gt;<i> ugly.
</I>
I would suggest simply putting function definitions before their uses so
that Perl can check their prototypes in the obvious way, adding extra
forward declarations only where necessary (mutual recursion). I
generally find this to be a clearer style anyway.
