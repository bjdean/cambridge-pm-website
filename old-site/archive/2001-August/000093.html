There are details on <A HREF="http://cam.pm.org/meets.shtml">http://cam.pm.org/meets.shtml</A> which answers some of your
questions.

Assuming you're driving up, I'd recommend junction 13 on the M11,
turn right when you come off the motorway, and that gets you into north
Cambridge avoiding a lot of hassle. However, I'd hope at this point that
someone in Cambridge (I'm within trebuchet range of the Tower of London)
will at this point pipe up with how the traffic restrictions and parking
works round there.

However, I was planning on going up by train, which gives me about a 30
minute walk from Cambridge station to the pub.
