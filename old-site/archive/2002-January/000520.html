Call For Participation YAPC::Europe::2002 - September 18-20

Registration is open from January 2002

	<A HREF="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/registration.html">http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/registration.html</A>

Conference fee is set at 89 Euros.

YAPC is an inexpensive 3-day grassroots perl conference, where users, and
developers, can mingle, listen, talk, and exchange ideas about the perl
programming language.  This year's conference will be held in Munich,
capital city of Bavaria, (as near to the continental centre of Europe
as you can get, without spotting the sea), Germany.

There will be a mixture of short and long tutorials and talks, covering
a wide variety of subjects.  This year's theme is 'The Science of Perl',
which means that we talk about science as well as everything else :-)

A huge variety of speakers and subjects on our favourite language is
gathering in Munich in 2002:  The author of perl, Larry Wall, is slated
to attend his first European YAPC, Damian Conway, perl evangelist and
speaker par-excellence, will also be participating, among many others.

We look forward to seeing you there too!

Call for Papers has been sent out and is available from the web site.

Note that because the number of participants is limited to 500,
(and particularly because the Oktoberfest has been planned to take
place directly after our conference), this time of year in Munich is
expected to be quite busy, therefore early booking for both conference
and accommodation is advisable.
