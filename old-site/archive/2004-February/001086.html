<PRE>Hi,

I'm new about here, love Perl and would be interested to get involved with
cam.pm.  :-)

By way of introduction, I'm a first year Computer Science student at the
university.  I've been doing web programming in Perl for a few years now,
and have done various other things with it too.

More recently, I've played a (small, insignificant) role in the development
of Parrot, mainly consisting of a few patches to fix stuff.  I also do the
Parrot On Win32 binary distribution, and am working on a Parrot Win32
library.  Aside from that, I lead development of AMaMP, an open source cross
platform audio engine.  This is done in C (configure script and test script
aside - which are done in Perl!), but I am going to start working on a Perl
binding soon as the engine is finally starting to become usable, and maybe
even slightly useful.

Well, that's me.  BTW, anyone planning to go to YAPC::Europe?

Later,

Jonathan
