Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Damian reminders, tech meet chivvy

Just a quick reminder of the special meetings next week (that's Tuesday
27th and Thursday 29th) at London's Conway Hall, where Damian Conway
(and, on Tuesday, Hugo van der Sanden) will be speaking to us about the
future of Perl 5, the future of Perl 6, and Life, the Universe and
Everything.

There'll be reminders on the main list on Monday and Wednesday, too. I
see that my earlier request for the meeting to be well-publicised seems
to have worked (thanks everyone) so it could be busy. The Conway Hall
opens at 6pm and talks will begin at 6.30.

Full details of the venue and talks are on the London.pm website:
<A HREF="http://london.pm.org/meetings/">http://london.pm.org/meetings/</A>

The next social meeting will be on Thursday 5th September, at a venue
to be confirmed, quite probably the Calthorpe Arms. The venue will be
confirmed by the second of Damian's talks, though.

The next technical meeting will be on Thursday 12th September, a week
earlier than usual because of YAPC::Europe. I'm still looking for
speakers, venues and (most hopefully) a volunteer to do all of the
tricky organising stuff for me.

Thanks,
