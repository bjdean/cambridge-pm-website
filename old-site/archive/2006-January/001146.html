***IP Telephony: You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet
Developers now have the right tools and the right motivation to build a wide 
range of new desktop applications, telephone services, and corporate phone 
systems that integrate voice with the Web, IM, WiFi, and more. Ed Stephenson 
talks with program cochair Surj Patel about what's emerging in telephony, 
and what you can expect to learn at O'Reilly's upcoming Emerging Telephony 
Conference.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/etel/2006/01/05/ip-telephony-you-aint-seen-">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/etel/2006/01/05/ip-telephony-you-aint-seen-</A>

***MacVoices #521: Getting the Most Out of eBay with Nancy Conner
Didn't get what you wanted for the holidays? Need to get rid of what you did

***Clone Pong, Using Only SDL (and Your Brain)
One of the great things about the games of yore is that they tended to be 
pretty simple, and as Josh Glover explains, Pong is one of the simplest to 
implement. In this first article of a three-part series, Josh shows you how 
to clone Pong all by yourself.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2005/12/15/clone-pong-using-sdl.h">http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2005/12/15/clone-pong-using-sdl.h</A> 
tml&gt; 

 

***Inside NetBSD's CGD
Security-minded laptop users live in fear of theft, not only of their 
computer, but also of their precious secret data. NetBSD's CGD project is a 
cryptographic virtual disk that can protect sensitive data while acting like 
a normal filesystem. Federico Biancuzzi recently interviewed its author, 
Roland Dowdeswell, on the goals and implementation of the system.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/12/21/netbsd_cgd.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/12/21/netbsd_cgd.html</A>&gt;

***The Power of mdfind
In addition to the little blue magnifying glass in the upper-right corner of 
your desktop, Tiger provides the mdfind and mdls commands for searching. 
Andy Lester discovered them while working on his updates to &quot;Mac OS X Tiger 
In A Nutshell.&quot; Essentially, they provide the power of Spotlight in the Unix 
shell. Here's how it works.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2006/01/04/mdfind.html">http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2006/01/04/mdfind.html</A>&gt; 


***Mac Users and the Macs They Use
When you read the articles and weblog posts by prominent Mac users and Mac 
pundits, do you ever find yourself wondering what kind of computer setup 
they're using? Giles Turnbull does. He recently contacted a spat of Mac 
professionals and asked them what they depend on. Here's what they had to 
say.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/12/28/mac-users-and-the-macs-the">http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/12/28/mac-users-and-the-macs-the</A>

***Unit Testing in Visual Studio 2005 Team System
Unit testing is one of the tasks that every programmer worth their salt 
needs to do. Wei-Meng Lee shows you how to use the new Unit Testing feature 
of Visual Studio 2005 Team System to auto-generate the code needed to test 
your application.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2006/01/03/unit-testing-in-vi">http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2006/01/03/unit-testing-in-vi</A>

***Just-In-Time Data Loading For DataGrids
One of Jesse Liberty's clients has a problem: she has a database with 2 
million records and wants to display these records in a data grid, but does 
not want to load them all into memory from the database. She wants them 
loaded &quot;just in time.&quot; Jesse shows how to use the new DataGridView to neatly 
solve the problem.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/12/20/just-in-time-data-">http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/12/20/just-in-time-data-</A>

***Using Global/Distributed Transactions in Java/JDBC with Oracle Real
Application Clusters
Maintaining transaction integrity, and rolling back failed steps, becomes 
more difficult on a cluster. One option is to move some of the load 
balancing decisions to your code, and account for which cluster nodes you're 
using. Sachin Shetty shows how this works in the context of an Oracle Real 
Application Cluster.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/12/21/global-distributed-transactio">http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/12/21/global-distributed-transactio</A>

***Maven Project Reporting and Publishing, Part 1
Maven's not just about building; it's about viewing, understanding, and 
managing your projects. In this first part of a two-part excerpt from 
&quot;Maven: A Developer's Notebook,&quot; authors Vincent Massol and Timothy M. 
O'Brien introduce Maven's reporting features for issue tracking, 
dependencies, code style, and more.

***Introduction to Camera Raw
Adobe's Camera Raw is arguably the most popular RAW-format converter 
available today. In this video, Deke McClelland introduces you to this tool 
and shows you tips for making image adjustments.
&lt;<A HREF="http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2005/12/16/camera-raw.html">http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2005/12/16/camera-raw.html</A>&gt; 


***Andy West: From Dregs to (Software) Riches
Dixie Dregs co-founder Andy West discovered that virtuosity can be a 
liability in the music world, but a benefit in technology. Now this 
four-time Grammy nominee programs computers by day and pursues his amazing 
music at night, drawing the best from both disciplines. Here's how.

***Register for O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference
We're five years into the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference and the 
stuff of which it is made shows no sign of abating: bandwidth continues to 
broaden, storage grows ever larger and cheaper, and content keeps streaming 
from the firehose. How do we visualize all of this digital data, filter it, 
remix it, and access it in meaningful ways? The coming technical challenge 
is not about generating digital content-we have more than enough already. 
It's time to do something with that data. It's time to build The Attention 
Economy. 

O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, March 6-9, 2006 Manchester Grand 
Hyatt, San Diego, CA
