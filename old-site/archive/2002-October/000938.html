<PRE>You've probably read about this elsewhere, but I don't think I've directly
plugged it to the cam.pm list yet, so here goes:

		 $$$ Make The Perl Foundation money fast $$$

I, Nicholas Clark, hereby offer 6 rewards, each of 100 guineas, to be paid
to the Perl Foundation, for the the first article deemed to be &quot;good enough&quot;
by my judges, in each of the following categories:

  * INTERCAL is better than perl

  * Brainfuck is better than perl

  * Befunge is better than perl

  * $foo is better than perl (three rewards)


100 guineas in real money is 105 pounds sterling. (about $160 or 160 Euros at
current exchange rates).  The intent is to make fun of articles which are of
the form &quot;my language is better than your language&quot;. $foo here is any language
that makes a suitably funny subject when compared with perl in this style.

Schwern and Greg McCarroll are the judges; please send your articles (and any
questions) to <A HREF="mailto:spoofathon@perl.org.">spoofathon@perl.org.</A>

You can bribe the judges using <A HREF="https://donate.perl-foundation.org/">https://donate.perl-foundation.org/</A> :-)
