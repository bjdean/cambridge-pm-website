I think what I really meant is &quot;equivalent provided the scalar
contains no shell meta-characters&quot;. (Then it's correct, yes?)

Also, the simple scalar arg version uses execvp instead of .. whatever
the other one does. I think the implications are PATH searching,
efficiency somewhere and lying to 'ps' about what you're running. I'm
hoping Lucy doesn't care too much about these things ATM. 8-)

Oh, also $? contains other stuff as well as the return code.

Nothing. What's wrong with my brain? I think it's empty again. Maybe I
should stop trying to be helpful, at least until it refills.
