</I>&gt;&gt;<i> According to the 2005 Perl Monger census[0] we still exist, so I wondered

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can't let those brummies drink us under the table ;P

</I>&gt;<i> Are there any vaguely sensible city centre pubs? Can I ask to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> Wednesday eves, as I play bridge in Witersfield that night.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Wednesday would not suit me either.  I can do other evenings.

&gt;<i> Tuesday would mean I would turn up a bit later, but otherwise, I would
</I>&gt;<i> be happy with any night. I think. No, wait, I have a life, honest, but
</I>&gt;<i> workarounds always um, worked around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, if it is on a school night, and I am driving back home (not
</I>&gt;<i> being a city centre type) then little alcohol would be quaffed. But I
</I>&gt;<i> can talk forever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Provided it's somewhere I can walk to from Emmanuel College in a sensible 
amount of time, I'll come and make sure there's someone to listen to you 
talking forever.  I don't promise to listen forever though.  ;-)

&gt;<i> And as for brum-types drinking us under the table, hah, not a mission. I
</I>&gt;<i> mean, they are from Birmingham. BIRM-ING-HAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> In perl-related excitement, as part of my recently-promoted duties, today 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got to parse large bits of PubMed[2] and battle with Spreadsheet::Excel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Heh, my Perl fun today consisted of hacking the code that generates the op 
translation dispatch code for my .NET =&gt; PIR translator so it could handle 
2-byte instruction codes as well as the single byte ones.  Fun, huh...  I 
can run 100 or the 212 .NET ops on Parrot now though, which is kinda nice, 
but means there's still some way to go.
