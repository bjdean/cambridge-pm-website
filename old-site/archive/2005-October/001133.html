</I>Yeah, I'm back for the term.  And yes, I'll give my talks if anyone wants to 
listen to them.  I can also do a Parrot talk and a basic Perl 6 one, if 
anyone would want to hear those.  I suggest, not all on the same night.  ;-)

I can make any location I can walk to from the town center, and any day 
apart from Wednesdays and Fridays.  Ah, and I'm only in Cambridge for 
another year, and only during term time anyway, so I doubt I'd be a good 
candidate for leader.  Unless you only want to meet in term time, and find 
another leader in a year's time.  :-)
