Web Development with Apache and Perl
By Theo Petersen

Greenwich, Connecticut, May 2002 -- Web Development with Apache and Perl
teaches web developers how to easily build a site with features like message
forums, chat, session management, custom preferences and other features.
More than a programming book, it covers a wide spectrum of practical issues
and how to handle them such as when to use a database, what information
needs to be secure (and how to secure it), and how to keep traffic from
crippling a website. It teaches the empowering use of ready-made modules so
developers do not have to reinvent the wheel. It even teaches how to
successfully advocate the use of Open Source tools in the corporate
environment.

What's Inside Web Development with Apache and Perl
* CGI and mod_perl programming
* mod_ssl, mod_rewrite and other Apache modules
* Using DBI with databases
* HTML::Mason and Template Toolkit for embedded scripting
* User login and session management
* Performance and system monitoring tools
* Growth planning and disaster recovery
* Sample layouts for community, corporate and e-commerce sites.

About the Author
A web developer committed to Open Source tools, Theo Petersen has spent many
years collecting experiences from other developers and evaluating web
development languages, add-ons and techniques to create a best-of-breed
toolkit for web applications. This book is the result. Theo lives in Denver,
Colorado.
