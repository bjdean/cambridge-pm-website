I don't know of one. The only one I do know of is the Oxford one written
by Simon Cozens (who now works for OUCS), but obviously that's less useful
when in the Fenlands. :-)

Certainly I believe it to be something that more than one person would
benefit from, and I can't believe you're the first person to want to do
this. I'm quite happy to have it as a project on the website, or to link
to one of your choosing.

BTW, I've had 4 entries so far, keep them coming in, they've been really
good fun to analyse, and I have a nice long explanation email (and a web
page, that I'll make at the time I send the email) of how they work, and
what I thought of the techniques used. :-)
