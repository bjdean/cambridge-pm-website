<PRE>Lucy McWilliam sent the following bits through the ether:

&gt;<i> Well, some strange people might care about the subject of the talk before
</I>&gt;<i> planning on venturing down to the big bad capital.  Then again, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> not ;)

What with all this interest I've now got provisional info, which needs
Damian's confirmation/approval, but I'm going to be rude and post it
here instead. (Sorry Damian.) This is NOT YET FIXED IN STONE, but if
you really feel the need to post it to other groups, feel free to work
it into my post to announce.

Start: 6.30 on the dot (venue opens at 6)
Talks: Tuesday 27th:  Life, the Univere and Everthing

       Thursday 29th: Perl 6 Prospective

Hopefully this answers everyones questions; if you have any further
comments on talks or times, please think hard about whether they need to
go to list or can be addressed to me personally.

Happy now? ;-), Leon
