NASA'S MISSION CONTROL TO HELP SANTA

     NASA flight controllers in Houston will transform
themselves into Santa's helpers this Christmas Eve, guiding
the jolly soul on his appointed rounds.

With the assistance of the International Space Station crew
in orbit, space station flight controllers in NASA's Mission
Control will monitor Santa's speed, reindeer performance and
cargo of presents for children throughout the world.

&quot;With three people living on the space station, we have a
unique vantage point to help Santa on his rounds,&quot; said Matt
Abbott, flight director. &quot;We have Yury Onufrienko, Dan Bursch
and Carl Walz on board the station ready to help us out with
real-time Santa sightings, and our flight control team is
ready for this opportunity.&quot;

Mission Control Houston, home to legendary flight directors
and expert flight control teams, will for a short time this
Christmas Eve become &quot;Santa Control, Houston.&quot;

&quot;Santa Control, Houston&quot; will be shown on NASA Television
during the NASA Video File December 24, which will air at
noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. EST. NASA TV is available on
GE2, transponder 9C. The frequency is 3880 MHz with an
orbital position of 85 degrees West Longitude, with audio at
6.8 MHz.

International Space Station can be found on the Internet at:
