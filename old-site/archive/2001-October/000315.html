Subject: Invading Cambridge


Mission date: 12/10/2001

A crack team of London perl mongers [1] ventured far outside of their
normal environs to invade the home of cam.pm.

Their assembly was successfully assaulted, despite being holed up in a
very defensible position at the very top of the pub, and much decent beer
was quaffed [2]. A smaller group than we would expect at a london.pm meet
but all fine people and most welcoming of the invasion force. A neutral
observer, in the form of Simon Cozens (lathos), was also welcomed into the
group.

Following this we were billeted at the home of cam.pm's own fearless
leader Lucy (sphyg) where we were made most comfortable and fed with fine
food, tea and bandwidth.

Saturday's mission was a skirmish at Lucy's house, where we faced a
combined assault from crack teams of Cambridge goffs and geeks. Despite
losses in the afternoon (Leon heading home) and the evening (Sue going
AWOL to another party) we put in a creditable display of london.pm
drinking ability.

Sunday is best left to the imagination of the reader.

So a big thanks to cam.pm for the welcome and to Lucy in particular for
the floor space.

Simon.

[1] The team comprised Leon (acme), myself (essuu), Sue Gray (grue), Tony
Fisher (aef).

[2] and I drank Guinness which doesn't count according to Lucy.
