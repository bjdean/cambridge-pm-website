<PRE>Hello again Perlmongers.

I was wondering about modules. I don't have root on a certain machine (the
very machine this list is running on, so be glad I don't have root!) and I'd
like to install a module. More than that (which would probably just mean me
asking mbm), I want to repeatedly install, remove, and bugger about with it
to my own perverse ends.

I've come across lots of ways to do this and although many of them work, I
don't really understand the funky autoloader stuff and my brain is full at
the moment. I've tried blib, but I get the impression it's not what it's
designed for and although it works, it's rude to me on stderr which is bad
for my self-esteem. At the moment I just put blib/lib and blib/arch trees in
my homespace and added both of them to PERL5LIB.

Any suggestions of better things to do? I can't find in the man pages any
destructions on how to install modules as a non-root (branch?) user.

I'll perhaps see some of you at the House!warming Tomorrow?

Dan.
