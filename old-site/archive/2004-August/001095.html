<PRE>Greetings, people.

Um, well, I hate to do this, but youse being local perlmongers and all,
I thought you might be somewhat approachable.

It seems that I have accepted a job in Cambridge, and will be moving
over to spread my own brand of joy to Engerland.

So, well, you know, living and all. Areas to avoid? Initially I will be
looking at a one bedroomed flat sort of gaff, until I can drag the brood
over. Which will then mean finding the postcode where all the best
schools are. Grief, how very middleclass of me.

All information gratefully received. For which in return I am willing to
donate pintage. Or pie-age, whatever floats the East-of-England boat. Or
punts the um, gondolas, being that part and all.

Oh, I should have introduced myself, shouldn't I? Hello. And yes, I
shall attend some meetings. I will be the one with the unintelligable
accent muttering about yes, real ale is good, but it isn't the black
stuff and all that...

m.
