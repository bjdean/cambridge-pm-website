We played about with both of these on (void) last year when I was
summarising it [0], and richardc, veeg and I were batting around
various ideas at YAPC::Europe last year.

In the end veeg did make a patch to pipermail so the message-ID was in
a comment in the HTML of the page, which made tying things together
much nicer. I think we dediced that the first idea (adding a
List-Suggests-Archive-URL, or something a little shorter) would have
been better, in the long run. (It would also have made summarising
easier.)

[0] I used to read through the mbox, picking out message-IDs and pasting
    them beneath the relevant block of text, then run a script to pull
    the message-IDs out of the HTML and cross-reference everything
    resulting in pages like [1] [2]
[1] <A HREF="http://husk.org/void/summ/">http://husk.org/void/summ/</A>
[2] although I think the (void) archives got reset after that summary...
