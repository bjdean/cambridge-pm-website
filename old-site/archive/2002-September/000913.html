Hmmmmm - I'm guessing that your keyboard and mouse are made out of plastic ?
Whilst its unlikely to be this since plastic generally doesn't conduct
electricity, it could be down to a dodgy earth on the plug to the machine,
either in the plug or socket on the machine. I've seen some fun results
where a machine's earth was floating at around 70V and was happily earthing
itself across its network connection to another machine. This was only noticed
when people realised that 10Base2 connections *really* shouldn't produce a
spark when you unplug them.

It could also be a static shock as well.
