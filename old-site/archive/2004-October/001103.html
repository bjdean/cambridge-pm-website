Whereas I missed it for the first time in months (maybe a couple of years)
partly by being in bed (asleep - spend 16 hours solid in bed. This is good)

Then again, I saw Matthew Garrett on Thursday morning (in our living room)
so does that count as a quorate cam.pm meeting? :-)

When *is* the next cam.pm meeting? Will there be nice beer?
