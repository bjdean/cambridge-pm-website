&gt;<i> Hi Guys,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I'd pick your brains for tips on jobhunting 
</I>&gt;<i> here. I'm looking for Unix Sysadmin CONTRACT work so I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> kinda forced to go through the agencies since the big 
</I>&gt;<i> companies don't seem to want contractors or have 
</I>&gt;<i> incredibly slack HR departments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thought I had it down pat from last time - just blast 
</I>&gt;<i> away applying for anything on jobserver/go jobsite, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Do these guys actually read their email???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have 7 years experience and heaps of skills so 
</I>&gt;<i> I &quot;shouldn't&quot; have trouble finding something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I've had one real phone call in the last week and one 
</I>&gt;<i> email. The rest are people trying to get you to do 
</I>&gt;<i> permanent work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas for approaches, good agencies, good websites? 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm getting SOOOO bored not working!!

Hi Sue,

Welcome to the UK in the middle of the biggest jobs recession
for some time :(

I've not looked for a contract since the end of last year but
there are others on the list who can tell you that it's pretty
grim out there in the contract market right now.

I usually use joberve.com to find leads, but I've found that
most of the jobs listed on there are fakes planted there to harvest
CVs. I've also found that most agents are incapable of replying
to an email. You _have_ to follow up your initial email with
a call to stand any chance of them dealing with you[1].

But the story that I'm hearing from everywhere is that the contract
market is almost completely stagnant. The few companies that
are taking on staff are trying to get permies.

Having said that, if you've got good skills then there's no reason
why _someone_ shouldn't want to take you on. Even as a contractor.
It's probably just a case of being tenacious.

And making those calls.

hth,

Dave...

[1] And on more than once occasion that call has consisted of
me leading the agent thru how to install Acrobat Reader so he
can read my CV[2]. 

[2] Yes, my CV is distributed in PDF. I find that best as that
stops agencies from editing it. This causes massive confusion
to agents and on occasion they've even resorted to either a)
copying the text and pasting it into Word or b) retypoing it
from scratch.
