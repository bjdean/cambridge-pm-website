<PRE>&gt;<i> Just a reminder that there's a social meet this evening (Tuesday 20th) 
</I>&gt;<i> in the Carlton Arms (www.thecarltonarms.co.uk) from 7pm ish.  We plan on 
</I>&gt;<i> being in the lounge bar (on the left hand side) and there'll be a purple 
</I>&gt;<i> frog on the table.
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, you can join us in #cam.pm on irc.perl.org.

Thanks for the social, L. Good to catch up with you. I *think* we agreed 
to set up a technical talk early in the new year. We have offers from 
several people to give talks, but the more the merrier. They can be on 
anything about Perl, complex or simple, and how you use it, and be it 5 
minutes or an hour, all contributions welcome!

How would doing a Saturday fit with people? Could fit it around lunch, 
so no hurrying from work to get there and no early morning starts.

TTFN

PS Lucy, don't forget the web site - we ought to get that updated.
