Welcome to the Cambridge(UK) Perl-Mongers Website source code project
=====================================================================

In February 2009 we migrated the existing http://cam.pm.org/ contents onto
github more or less in tact (stored in the old-site directory) and then
started work on updating the site contents (less the old mailing list
archives) in the htdocs and cgi-bin directories.

This project uses git for change control. To work on the source code:

 * Register for an account on http://github.com/

 * Grab the latest copy of the repository.  With git you can
   use:

     git clone git://github.com/bjdean/cambridge-pm-website.git 

   If you've got your commit-bit already, you can use:

     git clone git@github.com:bjdean/cambridge-pm-website.git 

   If you're working without git, you can download the master
   branch files at:

     http://github.com/bjdean/cambridge-pm-website/tarball/master

 * Do all your work on the a branch.

   If you're working on an already existing branch check it out
   as follows:

     git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name
     git merge master
     git push origin branch-name

   Replace branch-name with the branch name.  The 'git merge master' will
   make sure you've got the latest changes.  The push line will make sure
   your changes go back to the main repo.

   To create a new branch:

     git checkout master
     git pull
     git branch branch-name
     git push origin branch-name
