<PRE>In article &lt;<A HREF="mailto:20020227235727.A23630@colon.colondot.net">20020227235727.A23630@colon.colondot.net</A>&gt; you write:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Can you owe me beer too, even though I went to see ESR (a mistake, I think,
</I>&gt;<i>I should have come up to cambridge instead). Let it be known that ESR has
</I>&gt;<i>an ego that extends arbitrarily far in any direction, and is generally a
</I>&gt;<i>pratt.

I looked at the title of the talk and concluded that it would be exactly
the same as the one he gave a few years ago when &quot;Open Source&quot; was a dodgy
spin-doctoring of the term &quot;Free Software&quot; and when the web hadn't yet
made the Jargon File look horrifically inaccurate as well as biased.

RMS, on the other hand, has changed: his hair is tidier and only just
goes below his shoulders, his beard is neatly trimmed, and he can talk
interestingly about copyright as applied to stuff other than software.

Sorry you didn't spot us in the pub, Simon. I have to admit that I wasn't
there until 20:00ish...

Tony.
