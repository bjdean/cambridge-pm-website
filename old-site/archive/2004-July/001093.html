&gt;<i> I'm looking at writing a backup script to replace Amanda, as Amanda is
</I>&gt;<i> rather inflexible. There are some very specific requirements I'm
</I>&gt;<i> trying to implement:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - most of the target is source checkouts in people's home directories,
</I>&gt;<i>   therefore consists of many, many identical small files;
</I>&gt;<i> - but some of the files are very large (although none over 2Gb yet)
</I>&gt;<i> - total area is up to about 250Gb
</I>&gt;<i> - we want to fit as much of that as possible onto one 20/40Gb tape
</I>&gt;<i> - we want users to be able to select what gets backed up, defaulting to on
</I>&gt;<i> - we want to identify users with disproportionate backup requirements
</I>&gt;<i> - maybe implement quotas on the above
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had the idea to deduplicate files on the tape by e.g. MD5sum. But I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know of a standard archive format that supports that. Ideally I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like the tape format to be reconstructable with standard tools for obvious
</I>&gt;<i> reasons. Failing that, I'll stick a copy of the restore script on the
</I>&gt;<i> front of every tape.

Here is a quick and dirty approach that assumes file with similar
contents will have similar basenames:

  * Generate the full filename list
  * Sort the filename list as follows:
    1) all directories precede all regular files
    2) directories precede their subdirectories
    3) for regular files, filenames are transformed by reversing the
       order of filename components before being sorted lexically
       (i.e. /home/pete/dir/file.c becomes file.c/dir/pete/home/)
  * Create a tarball (or whatever), and filter that through gzip or
    bzip2 (or whatever)

Making similar-content files likely to be near one another gives an
ordinary compressor more chance to take advantage of their
similarity.

Compared to your per-file de-duping it loses on files with same
content but different-enough basenames; but wins on files with similar
names and similar but not identical content (which seems like a useful
kind of thing for mostly duplicate source trees).

It probably loses on the very big files too, depending on the details
of the compression program; how significant this is will depend on how
many there are.

Compressed backups make me a little twitchy, but you're basically
proposing to compress them anyway...
