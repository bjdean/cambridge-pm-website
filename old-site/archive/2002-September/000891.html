A synopsis of what Parrot is, why it exists, what its aims are, and what
the plans for it in the future are.  That sort of thing.  Very much a
non-technical overview.  We were, after all, a bunch of
bioinformaticians, almost universally without any formal CS training, so
we don't have much of a clue as to what a &quot;continuation&quot; is, for
example - lisp not spoken here!
