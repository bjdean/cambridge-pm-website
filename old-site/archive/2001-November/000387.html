I tried this one once at a MUD meet, sitting next to the group, who didn't
know what I looked like, and listening to what they were saying. By one of
those amazing coincidences, someone unconnected with the meet, whom I
hadn't seen in years, shouted from across the room, &quot;Martin Keegan, WHAT
are you doing in this country?&quot;, and my cover was blown.
