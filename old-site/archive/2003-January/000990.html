The dump format's portable, though (well, they've changed it a couple of
times, but there's always a flag branch and a documented procedure for
migration). A trivial script like
<A HREF="http://riva.ucam.org/svn/cjwatson/bin/svn-backup">http://riva.ucam.org/svn/cjwatson/bin/svn-backup</A> is enough to generate
plain-text backups that you can if necessary edit by hand and reload.

I was worried about this at first too, but it makes sense when
considering how to overcome some of the obvious deficiencies of CVS and
dump/load seems to alleviate robustness problems.

&gt;<i> &gt; That reminds me.  I need to generate some new meeting dates and learn

I've offered education a few times; just need to arrange a time when
we're both in and both inclined to do this sort of stuff. :)
