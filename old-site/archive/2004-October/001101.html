My bad.  I have been be-thesised.  I recall Matthew Garrett volunteering
to be pub minion, though he may not have been sober at the time ;P  It
seems I'm going along to london.pm tonight, if anyone wants to join me.


&gt;<i> &gt; So, well, you know, living and all. Areas to avoid? Initially I will

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brood over. Which will then mean finding the postcode where all the

If it's not too late, then CB4 seems to be where everyone else lives.  
It's within walking distance of the city centre and has a very nice real
ale pub.
