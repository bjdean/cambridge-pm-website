<PRE>OK, I give up.  A script I wrote a while ago now says
 main::read_config() called too early to check prototype
   at /usr/bin/chiark-named-conf line 262.
and the like - a dozen or two, depending on exactly how it's run.

I've googled, I've RTFMd, and there is no standard answer to this
question AFAICT.  Typing `called too early to check prototype' into
Google is very illuminating, in fact - lots of other people have this
problem, but the answers they seem to be getting are unhelpful at
best.

So:

1. Where should I have looked to find the answer to this ?

2. If the answer to 1 is `it's not properly documented', then
   could someone please explain to me what I need to do to my script ?

3. Why oh why oh why oh why do the Perl maintainers keep pulling shit
   like this ?  I only just had them `fix' the `bug' which made $^F
   not work, the resulting change breaking a program I wrote some time
   before 1994.  If Perl isn't careful they'll find people writing Tcl
   instead to take advantage of its superior API stability.

For now I've grepped for all the function definitions in the script,
turned them into declarations, and stuck them all in a big list near
the top of the script.  This has bad the symptoms go away but is quite
ugly.

Ian.
