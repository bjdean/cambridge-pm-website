<PRE>Hi again all.

Is anyone planning on doing Portugal this year? (This is the intro, not
the main point.)

I tend to only get to every other one, and having missed the one in
Belfast (and me working there at that time, too. Or not. I was
Scandanavia-locked at the time.) it seems that I might attend this year,
if I can con^H^Hcajole^H^Hobtain some money from my overlords for the
trip. Else I may fund it myself. I still haven't got to the point yet.
Here it comes...

I would like to practice the talk prior to going, and would like to
practice it to youse lot. a perlmonger group. An elusive one, mind, but
one all the same. Could I convince people, at some point undefined in
the future (and preferablly after I have written the damned thing) to
listen to me?
