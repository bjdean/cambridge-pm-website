One thing it does is confuse trn, which uses the reply-to adress for the
attribution line.  This is considered trn's fault though rather than
anything else. :-) Mostly I agree with Richard on this though.

The bit in the article which talks about it adding nothing however does
gloss over the fact that a reply-to-all or followup will go to the
author as well as to the list.  And the next message with go to you, the
author you responded to and the list.  And if people aren't pretty
disciplined you end up getting dozens of copies of messages to a list
twice, which is a nuisance.

The right answer is for people to be careful and to fix it.  Dougsoc
have an interesting wrong answer whereby the list software only sends
you a copy via the list if you're not already a recipient, even keeping
a list of other addresses you use for this purpose.  Setting reply-to
just to avoid this I can see is also a slightly wrong answer, due to the
problems the article outlines.

It should just admit that this slight problem exists though, rather than
pretending it doesn't.
