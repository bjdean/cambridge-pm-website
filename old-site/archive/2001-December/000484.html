Damian and Dan are cute kids.  They smile and wave when you enter the
room.  But in 2003 they won't be smiling.  See, Damian and Dan are
dying.  They have a fatal disease called ovacheveritis, which speeds
up their metabolism and shortens their lifespan.  In less than 18
months, they'll be nothing but a greasy stain on a coroner's floor.

But Damian and Dan have a dream.  With only one year left to live, the
Make A Dream Corporation AG GMBH Inc. Co. Ltd. has offered them each a
one year for Perl and Parrot development.  You should have seen how
their little faces lit up when they heard about it!

But friends, that dream is still just a dream.  They need over a
hundred and fifty thousand &quot;postcards&quot; to make this a reality.  You
can fill out a &quot;postcard&quot; for any amount by including your credit card
number in the form at:
  <A HREF="http://www.perl-foundation.org/index.cgi?page=donate">http://www.perl-foundation.org/index.cgi?page=donate</A>

If this story has touched your heart, send them a &quot;postcard&quot;.  It
doesn't matter if you can't send them a big &quot;postcard&quot;, every
&quot;postcard&quot; helps.  And your company can send &quot;postcards&quot;, too!

So forward this to everyone you know and make two cute kids very
happy, or those you love will be plagued by boils and forced to eat
their own earwax and listen to &quot;My Sharona&quot; until their heads explode.

Little Randal didn't forward this message and his ass ate Manhattan.
Big Tom forwarded this message and ... well, never mind.  Little Larry
didn't forward this message and his car imploded.  Big Greg forwarded
this message and married a major hottie.  Phwoa!

&quot;POSTCARD&quot;!  NOW!  OR I'LL GET GEORGE BUSH TO TELL TONY BLAIR TO
INVADE YOUR FUCKING LIVING ROOM!  IT'S FOR THE KIDS!
