<PRE>I'm starting a job at Netbanx in Cambridge a week today, so I have to move
to Cambridge, and find somewhere to live.

This would all be easy enough, except my girlfriend (Andrea) doesn't move
over from Austria until the end of June, and I don't think that it's
feasible to choose somewhere to rent together until she arrives.

So I was wondering if anyone has a double room that I could rent for 6-8
weeks, until we are able to find somewhere long term. Robbie Bow has kindly
offered me the use of his spare room initially, so I won't be out on the
street on Monday night, but it's only a single room, so not going to work
once there are two of us.

So does anyone have a double room, or know of someone who has one, that is
available to rent for June and July?
