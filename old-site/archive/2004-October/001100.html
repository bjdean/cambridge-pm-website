	Hi there
=09
	I have a question about Perl that I can't get answered as I can't find
	any Perl forums on the net so I was wondering if you could answer this
	for me? by the way I'm based in St.Neots.
=09
	Can I install Perl and run in on an Apple Mac computer running OSX ?
=09
	Regards.
=09
	Nigel
