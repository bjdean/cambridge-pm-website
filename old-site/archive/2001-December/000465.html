What you need to do now is something to stop i going on forever if it's
not showing any sign of converging.

I've been picking this apart by email with Phil already :-)

 9   9   9
  1 8 1 8
 1 9 9 9 8

is a good example of a fragment which will never converge and get longer
and longer.  Other bits get into loops where you go round the same few
lines over and over again.  It's harder to just make an example of that
up off the top of my head I'm afraid.

I spent a week one boring summer doing lots of examples on paper and
seeing where problems were likely to occur.  There were certainly some
patterns, where specific things would make a sequence less likely to
converge.  The more of each letter there is the worse, more so if
they're in the middle than if they're at the ends.  My full name with 4
Es in is awkward.  But there were some that just failed despite looking
perfectly likley to succeed.

I can't remember any details though unfortunately.
