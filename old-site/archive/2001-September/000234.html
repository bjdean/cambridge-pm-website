Didn't someone mention October 5th? (first Friday of term. Do I go and
associate with all the other people just starting in my department, or do
I go and spend time with people who aren't going to want to talk about

I'm sorely tempted to reimplement this large pile of C++ I have to deal
with in Perl. My life would suddenly become a lot easier.
