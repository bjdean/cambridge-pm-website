I've skimread bits of LotR, and read a lot of the critiques and background
material (esp the linguistics stuff). The bits of the actual book I've
read get about as far as Elrond's Council, and I've also read the bit
about the Sundering of the Fellowship towards the end of the first volume.

By a very weird coincidence, not having slept nearly enough for a few days
in December, I went to see LotR in the cinema and slept through the thing. 
I'd never realised just how camp LotR was, and found the screenplay
particularly dull (and insufficiently conformant with the book). The bits
I saw on the screen were exactly the bits I'd read in the book, and
apparently between these points I snored very loudly and disturbed the
other cinema-goers.
