Are there any vaguely sensible city centre pubs? Can I ask to avoid
Wednesday eves, as I play bridge in Witersfield that night.

Tuesday would mean I would turn up a bit later, but otherwise, I would
be happy with any night. I think. No, wait, I have a life, honest, but
workarounds always um, worked around.

Of course, if it is on a school night, and I am driving back home (not
being a city centre type) then little alcohol would be quaffed. But I
can talk forever.

And as for brum-types drinking us under the table, hah, not a mission. I
mean, they are from Birmingham. BIRM-ING-HAM.

woohoo! So now you are minted, you can buy the drinks?
