<PRE>OK so suppose you're writing a small command line program which you want
to take a few options, and you don't fancy doing to option handling by
hand unless you really need to, what do you use?

The Camel book documents the Getopt::Std module, and I've been trying to
use that.  It has a couple of functions, one which takes a reference to
a hash and is supposed to populate the hash with the results, and
another which stores the results in a bunch of global variables.

I can't seem to get the former to work (any ideas where I might be
messing up?).  Ad I don't like the latter because global variables
aren't really appreciated by use strict and I can't get 'our' to work
(is this part of perl introduced later than 5.004?  Still trying to get
current stable version of perl to compile on our HPUX machines with no
success: IO've not had a huge amount of experience compiling things and
I tend to run out of ideas when it doens't just work :-).

Is there a better module out there?  Or am I just going to have to carry
on not using strict (current workaround)?  Or should I just do it
myself?  I mean it's only half a dozen options, it shouldn't be too hard
to do.
