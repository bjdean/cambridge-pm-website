<PRE>Hi Guys,

I thought I'd pick your brains for tips on jobhunting here. 
I'm looking for Unix Sysadmin CONTRACT work so I'm kinda forced to go through 
the agencies since the big companies don't seem to want contractors or have 
incredibly slack HR departments.

Thought I had it down pat from last time - just blast away applying for 
anything on jobserver/go jobsite, etc.
Do these guys actually read their email???

I have 7 years experience and heaps of skills so I &quot;shouldn't&quot; have trouble 
finding something.

But I've had one real phone call in the last week and one email. The rest are 
people trying to get you to do permanent work.

Any ideas for approaches, good agencies, good websites? 
I'm getting SOOOO bored not working!!

Cheers,

Sue
