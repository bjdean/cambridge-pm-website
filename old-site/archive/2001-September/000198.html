<PRE>Well, we had a pub meet last night; not as well attended as that last
one -- no Randal, but where were you all anyway? :-)

Brief summary:

We turned up in the Castle, we drank beer (and related substances), we
went to House!, people spodded until Tony stopped people spodding by
pulling the ADSL line out of the wall, people went to home/bed (I
presume).

Notable moments:

&quot;I got run over by a car, but didn't even ladder my tights&quot;
                                                   (Eleanor Blair)

&quot;I like dipping into the onion&quot; (Tony Finch)

Tony making a comment about MBM which caused Sue to attempt the nasal
insertion of her Guinness.

Tabloid newspaper headlines: see
                      <A HREF="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/misc/campm.html">http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/misc/campm.html</A>

The summoning of various people by the mentioning of their name
                                   (Martin Cooper and Ian Jackson)

Ian's three `R's: routing, routing, and something I've forgotten. It was
funny at the time, OK?

Sue attempting the nasal insertion of her coffee at House!

That's it for now -- I'm off to coffee...

Phil
