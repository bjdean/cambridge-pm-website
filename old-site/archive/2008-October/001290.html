<PRE>Hello

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a technical talk? We've had
offers of talks from a fair few people, which is good because it would save
you from one of my talks which are, frankly, rubbish. Also does anyone would
have a venue for such a talk? I'm guessing evenings are probably best.

Cheers



Robbie
