Ah, connected region analysis?

If running time is important, or the image is very large, /you don't want to
do it like that/ really.

If the image is being read in incrementally and is then thrown away because
it's too big, then the best thing to do is to create sticks of contiguous
set pixels on each row, and then merge them into stick lists based on which
sticks they're underneath, IYSWIM. One advantage with this representation is
that whilst at the end you usually want to convert it into a pixmap, for
some large strucutres with big holes in (like black borders around a page)
the stick representation is actually smaller.

If you want a cool fast algorithm, and the image at 32-bits would happily
sit in core, then there's one that I worked on with RRW. What you do is
first create this image (called the map) of the same size, 32-bits deep and
blank. You also create an equivalence class. That's a thing which records
what's equivalent to what. It's a data structure that receives assertions
like &quot;3 is equivalent to 6&quot; and &quot;6 is equivalent to 12&quot; and can answer
questions like &quot;is 3 equivalent to 12?&quot;. Anyway, you zoom through the
original image and look only at the pixel above and the pixel to the left,
and only then if your pixel is set. If the up pixel is set but not the left,
or the left but not the up, then set the equivalent position in the map to
the same value as the value in the map for the pixel that's set. If both up
and left are set and they've the same value in the map, then do the same. If
they're both set and have a different map value, set the value in the map to
one of them and assert into your equivalence class that they're equivalent.
If neither up or left are set, create a previously unused value for the map
and set it to that When you've done that for each class of equivalent
numbers choose a representive number (any of them). Then do a second pass
across the map, and this time recolour everything to the colour of the
representitive.

What you've got then is a map where each region is a different colour. It
kicks ass because though it's two pass it's got monster cache locality and a
simple inner loop.

One way to implement equivalence classes is with trees with only parent
links (or the array equivalent). You have something called the canon which
is the root of each tree (which you can use as your representitive in the
second pass). When two things are asserted to be equivalent, you zoom down
the tree of each of them to see what their canons are. If they're the same
you do nothing, if different make the canon of one point to the other
(making a bigger tree). When you find a canon from a number at some
distance, it sometimes helps to move the link to point to the canon itself
for speed.

eg, 1=2, 1=3, 4=3, 5=6

     1    5
    / \   |
   2   3  6
       |
       4

6=4
                                1
    1                         / | \
   /|\                      / / | \ \
  2 3 5 can be optimised to 2 3 5 4 6 if you want
    | |
    4 6

I'd recommend C, though.

Of course, this problem might not be connected region analysis. But I like
my rants. :)
