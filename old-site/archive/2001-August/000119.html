<PRE>Thought I'd do I quick summary to save sending lots of replies to the
list.  And nope, I'm not avoiding work.  Much.

* I think I can safely say the social on Friday night was a success.
About 20 people in total turned up - including many non-subscribers who
we managed to twist the arms of - and we crammed into the top floor of the
Castle between 2 other reserved tables (might try that trick for next
time).

* Randal was safely delivered into our company by my boss's boss (hence my
boss's cross-examination of me this morning) at around 9.30.  Incidentally,
reports from my spies at the Genome Informatics meeting at Hinxton say
Randal talked about how perl 6 development has been organised and that they
were going to change everything and get it done in 2 years.

* When MBM let him get a word in edgeways, Randal gave us a slide show from
his Stonehenge trip on Thursday, we all signed a random bit of paper (for lack
of beer mats) and he promised to come back in November.  Possibly.  I can't
remember the details of the rest due to people buying me beer.


And in other news:
* We now have about 35 subscribers, including digests.  For comparison,
london.pm recently celebrated their 3rd birthday and have about 300.
* Jonathan has volunteered to do summat with the web site...cheers.
* London.pm, via Sue, have challenged us to a drinking contest

&quot;With a face like this I won't break any hearts.
If I think like that I won't make any friends.&quot;
