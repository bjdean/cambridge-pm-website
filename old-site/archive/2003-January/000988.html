That reminds me.  I need to generate some new meeting dates and learn
CVS.  Or MBM will kill me.  It's been brought to my attention that there
are lots of perl things happening this year, but none of them are in the
UK:

 German Perl Workshop  5th-7th March
 YAPC::Israel          12th May
 YAPC::Canada          15th-16th May
 The Perl Whirl        1st-9th June
 OSCON (Feat. TPC)     7th-11th July
 YAPC::NA              16th-18th July (unconfirmed dates)
 YAPC::Europe          ????
 YAPC::Asia::Taiwan    ????
