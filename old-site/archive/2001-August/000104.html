He's greg, you'll get used to it. :-) There is <A HREF="http://jouke.perlmonk.org/YAPC">http://jouke.perlmonk.org/YAPC</A>
as the primary url instead, the camel should be under there somewhere... :-)

Where?

I would have been able to drink more, if I hadn't spent half the evening
trying to avoid you putting nail varnish on my fingernails, face etc. :-) oh
and not being asked about BSD kernel configuration and spodding.. :-) We
