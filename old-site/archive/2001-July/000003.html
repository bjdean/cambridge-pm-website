$$ is useful. $/ is very useful if you're playing with record-like files.
I occasionally use $., which is the current record number. $&gt; and $&lt; are
also useful, as they allow you to do the userid operations. I occasionally
use $_ too, $0, occasionally, and often $!.[1]

&gt;<i> and $&gt;, as in snippets like the following:
</I>&gt;<i>   ($user, undef, $uid, undef) = getpwuid($&gt;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   unless (scalar(grep(/$user/<A HREF="mailto:,@Gap4">,@Gap4</A>::Cfg::rebuild_users)) &gt; 0) {

erm. /^\Q$user\E$/, I think.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so how do I get a global variable when I need one then?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Just give its complete name including namespace, so:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or the shorthand

</I>&gt;<i> If you say so.  :-)
</I>
I think so, if you're talking about globals...

&gt;<i> &gt; I thought that $_ was supposed to be a package global, but a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experimentation shows that this isn't actually the case. :-(
</I>&gt;<i> $_ has all sorts of horrible magic associated with it though, doesn't it?
</I>
No. Builtin functions will often try to use $_ if they can't find other
arguments. There's no real magic associated with it. There's also no &quot;magic&quot;
in the perl sense, either, IIRC.

&gt;<i> Things like foreach automatically localize it, for example.  I'm not

That's not magic. That's using local.

&gt;<i> surprised if it behaves oddly in other contexts as well.  It's another

</I>
using it with map is probably my main use.

[1] for those who don't know and can't be bothered to look it up:
    $$ - process id
    $/ - record separator, useful with &lt;filehandle&gt; operators
    $. - current record number
    $&gt; - effective uid
    $) - effective gid
    $&lt; - real uid
    $( - real gid
    $_ - erm. well, too many meanings
    $0 - the argv[0] of this script
    $! - errno or strerror(errno)
