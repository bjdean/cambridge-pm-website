As much as I like having arguments, I'm fed up with this one.

There are reasons for and against. I've read them both, and when I set up
the list I decided to go for reply-to being set. Now, yes, it does cause
the occasional embarassing thing, and yes, it can be harmful, but I've
seen that happen in news too, and I've seen it happen in other media. If
you're used to &quot;replying to list&quot;, then you may do that as a finger macro
and the effect is the same.

I'm not going to argue for and against here, and despite the fact that we
don't have an official topic per se, I'm going to declare this argument
OT.

Quite frankly, people need to use their emailers, news clients etc.
sensibly. This kind of thing reminds people that they need to think before
they post things, and god knows I've been on the wrong side of that enough
times.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Anyway, to get back ON TOPIC, did we actually work out anything we wanted
to say in a tech meeting, let alone where one was going to be held?
