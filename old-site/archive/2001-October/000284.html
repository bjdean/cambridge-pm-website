<PRE>A reminder that our next social will be a week on Friday in the Castle
Inn.  I'd try and book upstairs except I've got far too many things to do.
Have a party invite instead.

The residents of the house named House! cordially invite you to an Owen
party.  There's a good reason for this, but you won't find out unless you
turn up.  Some crash/parking space available.  PBAB.  PBAF.  Please bring
an Owen.  The thousandth guest receives a free Owen.  No Owen's were
harmed during the composition of this invitation.

* Place: 11 Atherton Close, Cambridge, CB4 2BE, 01223 356412
* Time: Saturday 13th October, from sometime after dusk to sometime before
dawn.
* Directions: on request, depending how lost you are
* Alternate directions: type postcode into www.streetmap.co.uk
* Transport: no. 9 bus goes from bus station up Milton Road (required bus
stop is St Laurence church), no.5 bus goes from railway station, up
Milton Road, and turns down Gilbert Road
* Red licquorice: yes, please
