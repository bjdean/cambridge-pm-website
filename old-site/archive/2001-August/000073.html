<PRE>Icelandic, they also use =D0 and =F0 (eth?), as far as I could tell they =
sound the same as thorn.

Icelandic travel tip #1: Don't try the rotted shark (hakarl (sp?)), your =
mouth will never forgive you.  Think about it, back at home would you eat =
something that had been buried in gravel for nine months?

I'll see your =F8, =E6 and =E5 and raise you a =FE, and I don't need no =
fancy keyboard
for that, neither!  Incidentally, anyone know why thorn (=FE) is in
iso-8859-1?  Which language uses it?  Icelandic?  I'm guessing that
because it's also a rune.
