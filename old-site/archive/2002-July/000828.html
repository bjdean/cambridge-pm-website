Umm... my very favourite was Pom::PomObject, which was written by a
colleague at Incyte.  He wanted to open source it, but AFAIK, nothing
came of that, sadly.  It was a template for object classes which could
dump themselves as XML, and recreate themselves from XML. Nothing that
remarkable in that, Boulder::IO does something similar, but this was
very fast and had the added advantage that it could dump its own DTD,
and the XML was valid against that DTD, not just well-formed a la
Boulder::IO.

For sheer perversity I really like DBI::Chart.  Whoever was twisted
enough to realise that SQL actually makes quite a natural language for
describing charts really deserves some sort of medal.  What really
amazed me about it when I tried it was that it really works, and allows
you to draw really nice graphs, particularly from other DBI objects
connected to real databases, with extremely concise and clear code.

I'm also quite keen on tied objects as a means of hiding nasty
implementation details, or as means through tied dbm files of reducing a
script's memory usage.  Quite useful in my field.  Here be dragons
though - some DBMs seem to be really bad about creating vast sparse
files.  We just found one at work today.  The .pag and .dir files were
0.5 TB and 0.8 TB in 'size' (not sure which way round) and contained a
mere 40K and 67 MB of real data respectively.  We discovered this when
trying to move the data onto new storage, and rsync filled the target
RAID array completely.  Beware of rsync and sparse files!!!  I've never
had that problem with tied hashes and GDBM files though...
