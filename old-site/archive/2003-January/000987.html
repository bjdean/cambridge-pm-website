IME Subversion is excellent; I keep large parts of my home directory in
it these days. The main outstanding problems I've run into are:

  - doesn't yet version symlinks
  - no 'cvs annotate' analogue
  - doesn't do SSL certificate handling (but see below)

Still, for that and the stuff at
<A HREF="http://subversion.tigris.org/inconveniences.html">http://subversion.tigris.org/inconveniences.html</A> you get atomic commits,
proper renames and directory metadata, offline operation for a lot more
things than CVS, and so on. As far as safety is concerned, I've had no
problems, although I run 'svnadmin dump' from cron nightly just in case.

If you want to avoid the Apache2 dependency, there's a relatively new
repository access layer called ra_svn, which can be tunnelled over ssh.
You probably want to be using at least 0.16.1 for this; I haven't tried
it yet myself.

&lt;/advocacy&gt;

Cheers,
