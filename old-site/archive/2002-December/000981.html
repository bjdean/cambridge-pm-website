Hmm.. a quick google shows at least two programs claiming to be perfect
players, one of which is an on-line java applet.
There's a Dutch master's thesis on solving connect4 (the first player
wins on the standard 7x6 board; it's a draw for less-tall boards).
The perfect solvers seem to use a combination of results from this and
an 8-ply opening book.

Stiff competition....
