The Blue?  I'm sure there are others.

I would prefer a non-Wednesday day.  No doubt everyone has different
days to avoid.  8-}

I've just set Dad's Linux box up with dirvish.  It's Perl &lt;/obperl&gt;
and rsync.  It keeps multiple copies of the source filesystems and
uses hardlinks to economise on unchanged files.

He's only dumping to another disk in the machine, but with the magic
of ssh authorisation key pairs you can send it...  somewhere else, if
there is anywhere.

But not if rsync can't cope with the UFS+ filesystem?

...so I picked on Mozy to see what's out there these days.

&quot;448-bit Blowfish encryption&quot; and &quot;Public or private key encryption&quot;
are phrases from their website that ring alarm bells for me.

Do people really want closed software copying their data back to some
random company?  It doesn't seem like the best idea.


Not that Dirvish looks particularly easy to fit with encrypted storage
that can't be peeked on the archiving side.  Sigh.

I have no Windows boxes at the moment so it's all rather academic for
me.  I use a mixture of Unison and (tar | bzip2 | gpg &gt; DVD) for my
backups, but it's all rather slaphazard.
