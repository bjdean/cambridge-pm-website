<PRE>Hello all,

I'm looking at writing a backup script to replace Amanda, as Amanda is
rather inflexible. There are some very specific requirements I'm
trying to implement:

- most of the target is source checkouts in people's home directories,
  therefore consists of many, many identical small files;
- but some of the files are very large (although none over 2Gb yet)
- total area is up to about 250Gb
- we want to fit as much of that as possible onto one 20/40Gb tape
- we want users to be able to select what gets backed up, defaulting to on
- we want to identify users with disproportionate backup requirements
- maybe implement quotas on the above

I had the idea to deduplicate files on the tape by e.g. MD5sum. But I
don't know of a standard archive format that supports that. Ideally I'd
like the tape format to be reconstructable with standard tools for obvious
reasons. Failing that, I'll stick a copy of the restore script on the
front of every tape.

Anyone want to post their backup script that does anything like this? Or
want to offer advice on how to proceed?

Pete
