YA Empire House AICMFP. I'm wondering about DSL, looking at my dad's setup
(at his office) the £40/mth offering seems to actually emulate a modem
over the USB, so you dial &quot;0&quot;, and then bring up the PPP connection. I'm
starting to wonder how hard it can be under *BSD or Leegnux. WaveLAN is
utterly cool. My dad has just bought a Titanium laptop and an AirPort, and
I was tasked with getting it working. I borrowed an Orinico card too. It
works a treat, it's particularly cool printing something on a printers
halfway across the room, when you're sitting at a table with no wires on
the laptop.

I'd use the external cards, though, because they actually work, the
signal attenuation on the Titanium was quite scary...

&gt;<i> geekhaus?  And don't you just love foreign keyboards...ø æ å

I always have trouble with the computer of one of the sysadmins at work
who just has a uk-layout keyboard, with a us map.

MBM (not amazingly fond of laptop keyboards, although likes his shiny
     new laptop).
