Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Damian Conway, speaking at the Conway Hall

Damian Conway will be coming to London in August, and thanks to his
offer to talk to us, the efforts of a group of people who have made
donations to book a venue, and Richard Clamp who has gone to the venue to
book it, we now have a firm date and place for the meeting.

Damian will be speaking at the Conway Hall, Holborn on the evenings of
Tuesday 27th August and Thursday 29th August. So far the topic is not
fixed, but it seems likely one night will tackle Perl 6 and another will
be one of his talks on Perl 5, chosen from this list:

<A HREF="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Extreme.html">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Extreme.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Life.html">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Life.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Perligata.html">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Perligata.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Sky.html">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Sky.html</A>

If you have strong feelings about which talk you'd like to see, please
contact me off list, or talk to me at one of the forthcoming social
meetings.

Damian's Perl 6 talk is described here:

<A HREF="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Perl6.html">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/seminars/Perl6.html</A>

The Conway Hall on Red Lion Square, near Holborn tube station, on the
Piccadilly and Central lines.

<A HREF="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=530648&Y=181767&A=Y&Z=1">http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=530648&amp;Y=181767&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=1</A>

The time of the meetings has not yet been fixed, but it makes sense to aim
for as early as possible. (The venue closes at 9.45pm.) Again, if you have
strong feelings about whether or not you can make it to a meeting for
either
6pm, 6.30pm or 7pm, please contact me off list.

If you're in contact with other user groups who may be interested in seeing
one of the more renowned speakers in the Perl world, please feel free to
forward this mail, or be prepared to do so once we firm up starting times
(and get a page on the web site describing the meeting :).

Thanks,
