Run doublespace! =8-)

But seriously, do you have any reason to believe that a new disk won't
immediately fill with more genetics?

Unless you want a SCSI disk, but I think you'd know...

Some of the Deskstars don't have known problems (he says, running a
machine with a IBM-DTLA-307030).

Also, if spare IDE slots and power consumption aren't a problem, buy
something smaller than the largest. Plotting size vs. price is tedious
but useful.

If speed is important then you have to look at seek times and disk
rpm. If it's very important then you need a real hardware geek, and
striping, and funky tricks like that.


Oh, and then you need somewhere to put the backups. *sigh*
