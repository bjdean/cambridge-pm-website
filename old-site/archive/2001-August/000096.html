Junction 13 sounds fine. Once you get into Cambridge from there there's
a roundabout at which you turn left onto Northampton Street, and then
left from there onto Castle Hill. There's car parking on your right at
the top of the hill, just after the pub, where you should be able to
find some space.

(And after all that I'll be at HAL2001 and won't be able to meet Randal
and co. Oh well.)
