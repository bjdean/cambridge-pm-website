Well, it becomes a speed issue as well.  Certainly with large data
structures (such as wot I have here!)

while (($key, undef) = each %$hash) {
    ...
}

is *much* faster than

foreach (keys %$hash) {
    ...
}

I only ever use keys these days for one of the following reasons:
1)  Order is important (i.e. I need &quot;sort keys&quot;)
2)  The size of the hash is known to be very small
3)  I actually need the full array for some reason

'values' I use rather more often for creating non-redundant lists via a
hash.

It may be slow, but something like:

$foo-&gt;set_nr_list([ values %nr_hash ]);

is a lot more readable for other people than:

my $arr = [];
while ((undef, $value) = each %nr_hash) {
    push @$arr, $value;
}
$foo-&gt;set_nr_list($arr);

It may even be faster, although I suspect the [ values ] involves
copying the entire array into the new anonymous array reference.

[ tries a bit of benchmarking ]

Hmm.  Now I'm surprised.  I tried taking a reference to what values
returned, rather than enclosing it in [], and it's actually *slower*:

use Benchmark;

%foo = ();

for (1..100000) {
    $foo-&gt;{&quot;key$_&quot;} = &quot;value$_&quot;;
}

timethese (1000000, {
    'AnonRef' =&gt; '$a = [ values %foo ]',
    'Context' =&gt; '$a = \@{values %foo}'
});

11:28:42 <A HREF="mailto:timc@bio1">timc@bio1</A>:ticut$ perl test.pl
Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of AnonRef, Context...
   AnonRef:  9 wallclock secs ( 8.98 usr +  0.00 sys =  8.98 CPU)
   Context: 12 wallclock secs (10.33 usr +  0.01 sys = 10.34 CPU)

Curious.  Perhaps the [ values ] is actually optimised, so that values
puts its stuff straight into the new array reference.

Tim.
