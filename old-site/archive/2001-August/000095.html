Needs elaboration.

* The Castle Inn on Castle Street (not to be confoosled with The Castle on
St Andrew's St) is halfway up the only hill[1] in Cambridge at the
northwest corner of the city centre.

* The nearest multistorey is Park Street, though you can probably use
parking space at the council's offices at the top of the hill.  Also beware
that Cambridge has a strange one way system and pedestrianised bits - I don't
drive so I can't comment further.

* Extensive 'research' last week indicates that it should be hopefully quiet
(or at least until we get there) and we're likely to be upstairs.  Look out
for the camel/orangutan, depending on which of my stuffed animals is feeling
most sociable.  As 'responsible organiser' I'll aim to get there early (6ish)
and make sure the beer is up to scratch.  In case of emergenices, ring 07939
476024.

* See www.cammap.com - dontcha just love a clickety-map which shows the
pubs?
