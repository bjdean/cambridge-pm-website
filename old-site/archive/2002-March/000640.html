Ah good that it works.
Not good that it didn't work first time, and your description doesn't ring
any bells as to what the problem is. Are you using gcc, or the pay-for
HP-UX ANSI C compiler?

It usually is.

&gt;<i> &gt;Also, does the development 5.7.3 snapshot fail to compile?

Yes. 5.7.3 is out. There's a link on www.perl.com (I think) as &quot;devel is
5.7.3&quot; Jarkko wants to freeze for 5.8 in a week or two, so hopefully it
won't be forever. It is *development* perl so you're really not advised to
install it on machines in place of whatever you're using currently. But (by
default) it won't install as /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl, just
/usr/local/bin/perl5.7.3. This means that you can use it to test your
systems without buggering the machine's regular perl. (Although, still, it
would be foolish to do this on anything other than a development system)

It would be really useful if everyone on cam.pm could test 5.7.3.

[Yes, I realise that not everyone will be able to, but if you could, please
do]

Simply because if perl5-porters doesn't learn of the bugs in 5.7.3 with your
real-world scripts, then 5.8 will still have those bugs, and that's not in
your interest.

[it's not in perl5-porters' either, really, but I'm appealing to your
selfishness]
