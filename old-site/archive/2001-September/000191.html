Pg is a DBI DBD but with different function names really. I know that seems
evil bad and wrong but Pg is supported by Postgresql, installed, and allows
me to use cunning Postgres specific features not in the DBI interface as far
as I know (like directly tinkering with your backend!). The whole thing is
Postgres specific enough that porting over to DBI wouldn't gain much, except
I'd have to learn use a new interface well.

The bit I'm writing is a wrapper so that, for a paritcular database it's
being written for, people can do 

$dbase-&gt;xsuby($x,$y);

to the module, and the module can say

INSERT INTO subkind SELECT b.super,a.sub,FALSE AS direct FROM ( SELECT sub
FROM subkind WHERE super=$x UNION SELECT $x AS sub) AS a, ( SELECT super
FROM subkind WHERE sub=$y UNION SELECT $y AS super )AS b EXCEPT SELECT
super,sub,FALSE AS direct WHERE super=$y AND sub=$x;

to Pg (DBI, whatever). And also so that the slow migration to server-side
functions can be hidden from everyone else (not all of the examples are as
computationally clean as that, a perl PL has been ruled out, and the database
has a tight deadline for deployment).

I've realised I'm not really very good at either Perl or SQL, tbh, I think
I'm destined for middle management, if I'm lucky, a sideshow at the the fair
if not! :) Still, getting a job would be cool, there's only so much fun to
be had from SQL in your spare time. :)

Dan.
