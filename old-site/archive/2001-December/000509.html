<PRE>I recently installed Windows 98 after Linux (SuSE 7.2) without too much tro=
uble.

The first thing I did was create a DOS7/Win98 boot disk with some useful st=
uff on it (fdisk, format, etc.) and use it to create a FAT32 partition (you=
 do have some space on your hard disk, don't you?).  Then from Linux I copi=
ed the contents of my Win98 CD across to this partition.

Back in DOS I ran the Win98 setup program and everything worked perfectly, =
except that Win98's setup overwrites the MBR, so LILO didn't get run at boo=
t any more.  This was easily fixed by booting from the SuSE install CD, whi=
ch offers the option of booting an existing installation, once I was back i=
n Linux I could run LILO and replace the MBR.

Kevin.

I think it depends where you start from.  Starting from scratch it's
pretty straightforward IMLE.  Starting from a working windows install
and adding Linux without breaking it seems to have worked fine too,
given I had a spare partition set aside for this just in case.  Both of
these were as a complete newcomer to installing linux at all.

I gather it's harder to start from a working Linux install and add
Windows, but I could be wrong.  I've not tried that myself.
