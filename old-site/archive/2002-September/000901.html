Assuming that (1) wasn't part of the joke, I'd put the number one rule
as &quot;use hashes&quot; (&quot;use regexs&quot; is number two).

A C programmer will think of linked lists, pointers etc etc. Throw them
all away and use a hash. Linked list? Nah - use a hash. Tree? Nah - use
a hash.

The other rule of thumb is if you find yourself writing a C-style 'for'
loop, there is probably a better way to do what you want.

But there are a number of culture shocks. I can just about remember some
of mine:

Strings can have nulls in, and don't end with nulls.

Scalars are numbers and/or strings, whichever you want and you don't
need to worry about which they are (bitwise operators excepted).

&quot;Local&quot; isn't like C dynamic storage (I learned perl before &quot;my&quot;
existed. Simpler rule nowadays is to ignore &quot;local&quot;.)

Beware that 0 is false. (Applies to all perl programers :-)
