</I>I'm planning to submit one or two talks, and have also said to leo (of 
Parrot fame) that I'd be happy to work with him to co-present a tutorial, 
though we're not sure there would be sufficient interest.

&gt;<i> In summary then:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else going?
</I>&gt;<i> do we have a meet to speak? Or a meet to drink? Now that the good

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good weather my arse.  Unless it's somewhat better down in Cambridge than 
hear in Scarborough, of course...  I guess I shouldn't have spent the two 
weeks in Spain recently, then I'd still not remember what good weather is... 
Anyway, I'm back in Cam in a couple of weeks, so will try and make a meet 
provided it's on a night I can.
