Warn. Unless you have

</I>
at the top of your code :-)

Definitely (and in fact, trivially) solved without recursion, but I
started thinking about this and got interested...

FWIW, I've got a function which is zero across most of its domain, but
has a few irregularly shaped (but relatively large) areas in which its
value is non-zero. What I'd basically like is the average value of the
function across its entire domain; hence I want to sample the bits in
which it is non-zero. The previous ugly algorithm was:

* Look at point (x,y) and store its value.
* If non-zero, recurse to all of
    (x-1,y+1), (x,y+1), (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y  ),          (x+1,y  ), 
    (x-1,y-1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y+1)
  unless they've already been done.

Trivial fix (in fact, what I've already done) is to just use a
{list,stack} to store the points I'm going to need to look at, but I was
just wondering...
