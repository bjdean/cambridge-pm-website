reviews, and share knowledge through newsletters or Web sites. Manning will
provide a free book for presentation at meetings, for group libraries or for
door prizes in exchange for a written published review.

If your group is willing to write and publish a review, please contact Helen
Trimes at <A HREF="mailto:hetr@manning.com.">hetr@manning.com.</A> Reviews should be published in print or online
within sixty days of receipt of the free book at your group's website, in a

public forum. When requesting a free review copy, please include your plans
for posting the book review as well as your shipping address.
