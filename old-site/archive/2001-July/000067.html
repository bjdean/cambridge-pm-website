I was going to go to that on Saturday, but I'd quite like to come up to
cam at some point soon.

It's just been sitting unread in its mailfoler for me...

I'm certainly curious about this, and its possible that other people will
be too. Personally, where these conferences involve perl, we're able to
feel like there's some point to cam.pm in terms of idea transfer etc if
you do this. My 0.02, anyway.

Please do post some kind of report.
