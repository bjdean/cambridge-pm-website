<PRE>Hi All,

I'm not too sure if this is the right Ng to make this posting however, if it 
isn't I'd be grateful if you
could point me to the appropriate Ng for this post. I'm a recent convert to 
Perl, and I find the community
spirit very, very encouraging and admirable.

OK guys and girls,

I am working on a project (I developed it mostly in C/C++) and I would like 
to add Perl scripting to it,
and I would also like to expose some of my C functions to Perl (i.e write a 
Perl module that provides access
to my C functions). I have read some docu on Perl guts and SWIG and it seems 
like a pretty steep learning
curve to me (I need to finish this by the end of March). Plus, it would be 
much more time efficient to
enlist the help of one of the many Perl Gurus out there, to help me put this 
together as quickly as possible.

To sunmmarise, this is what I need help with :


a) Embedding the Perl interpreter in my application
   (I've already done this, but I need some further help with graceful
   exits when an error occurs, as well as a means of returning the error 
description
   [when something goes wrong]. Currently, my application crashes outright 
if something
   is wrong with my Perl script).

b) Opening an internet connection (i.e. dialing an ISP and logging on from a 
Perl script)

c) Downloading files from the internet and various ftp sites

d) Processing the files (one of them is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet)

e) Storing the processed data into a database

f) Generating an error report and sending it via e-mail to a provided e-mail 
address

g) Closing the internet connection (i.e logging off from the ISP)

h) Familiarity of using SWIG to automate the build of a SWIG interface file
  (for building the Perl module, based on my C functions)



Now for the best part ;-)

I don't expect any of you guys/girls to do this for free. I would not like 
to take advantage of the great
community spirit out there. So instead, I would like you to tell me what you 
would want to be paid for your
expenses/ time etc.

I reckon it's probably a weekend job (a full saturday or Sunday), for 
someone who knows their way around
Perl. The slightly complicated areas (for me anyway) are [a] and [h]. The 
rest are fairly standard
processes and there may even be scripts out there which do exactly this sort 
of thing. I have some perl
code I wrote, that we can chuck in, as well as some visual basic code that 
does most of the text processing,
so the logic/functional spec has been all sorted out, it's a case of 
&quot;porting&quot; the functionality to Perl,
which is much better at &quot;data munging&quot; anyway !

I would prefer whoever decides to help, to actually come and do the work on 
my computer, since we can get a
lot more done instead of mailing files back and forth and finding that 
things don't quite work because our
machines have different configurations etc, etc. Besides there'll be far too 
many header files and libs to
be passing around to even make it a practical alternative.

This is why I specify that a London programmer will be much more preferable. 
However, if you would like to
travel from anywhere (in the UK !), I will gladly pay your transportation 
expenses - I just need some help
to get this finished !. If we manage to finish this in a day (as I think we 
can), I promise to get you as
many beers as you can drink at the local pub !




Thanks for your time and please e-mail responses directly to me (not this 
newsgroup).

My email is <A HREF="mailto:perl_redhat_hacker@hotmail.com">perl_redhat_hacker@hotmail.com</A>



BTW, my e-mail addres is a bit of a red herring (no pun intended !) I'm 
developing on Windows 2K (NOT Linux) !



Regards


Neil
