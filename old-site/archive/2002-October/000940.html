No. First entry in each category that is &quot;good enough&quot; wins. There aren't
likely to be that many entries, so I don't want to feel forced to reward
the least bad entry that arrives within some deadline, particularly if
one category has no strong entries, but another has several really strong
entries.

Slightly more explanation of the &quot;good enough&quot; thing is at
