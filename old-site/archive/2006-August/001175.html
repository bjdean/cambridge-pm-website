<PRE>What-ho peeps.

There are some images on the cam.pm website that I would like to
nick^H^H^Huse in my talk at YAPC::Europe at the end of the month. And as
opposed to doing so unbidden, I would like to ask if whomever did them
objects, and if they tell me who they where, then there name will go on
my credits slide. 

You know the ones, the dollar_[underscore|at|qmark|star].jpg. Those
ones.

As about this time I should be thinking about my talk. Cause the
important things like asking who owns the images need done first. No
point in even thinking what I am going to say until that is sorted out.
Priorities.

Gosh, wireless in pubs is great, isn't it?
