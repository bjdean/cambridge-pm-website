Unfortunately I think you're going to find that the UK IT job market is quite
depressed at the moment - a lot of places are making staff redundant and are
cutting back on the number of contractors they are taking on. For example in
the company I work for (large US ISP/telco with offices on the Science park)
had an edict come down from on high (ie the US) at the beginning of the year
saying that all contractors were not to have their contracts re-newed. We've
also been in a hiring freeze since then as well. This is something which is
going to continue for at least another 5-6 months thanks to the recent
redundancies as well.

Another example is from the banking sector - apparently one back has just let
half of its contractors go and made the remaining half take a 10% cut in pay.

I also know of a number of Unix contracting companies who have around half of
their staff looking for new contracts.

However I've heard that Kent is quite a hot-bed of Solaris work WRT
contracting. As is Vienna.

Sorry that this is not the sort of answer you were looking for.
