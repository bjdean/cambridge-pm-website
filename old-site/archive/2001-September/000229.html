* Foo.  I only have time to talk rubbish on one perlmongers list, atm ;-P

* I'm just debating whether to post some code to the list in an attempt to
improve my blatently pants programming.

* We now have a couple of copies of the O'Reilly Perl success stories, if
anyone wants a look.

* I'm considering starting a Cam.pm library thingy, or at least a list of
techie books ppl own and wouldn' mind other ppl borrowing.  Hopefully we
might even get some freebies to review sometime.  Or we could at least
review some anyway.

* There's another webreview.com poll and perl was way in the lead the
last time I looked - <A HREF="http://www.webreview.com/polls/2001/poll_09_14.shtml">http://www.webreview.com/polls/2001/poll_09_14.shtml</A>

* Haven't got my diary with me but next social shall be a Friday,
hopefully with some Londoners.  And maybe even a party the next day.
