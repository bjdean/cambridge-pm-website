Falling over when I tried to run make.  It was finding some include
files but failing others.  Telling it to look for include files in
/usr/include instead of in /usr/local/include seems to have fixed the
problem.

Not yet got as far as make install since I'm being encouraged to build
it on a less crucial machine and neither of the ones available currenly
has enough space in /opt but at least make now runs and make test
passed, which I'm taking as a good sign :-)

Is that expected soon then?  There's nothing on the downloads page to
hint at that sort of thing.
