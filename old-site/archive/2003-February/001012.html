Scarily, I did mine by hand. The shape was badly chosen, and I've
learnt from it. :-) In mine, I needed several noops in various places
( &quot;&quot;. was very useful, for example). I also needed to reorder operations,
but of course, you have to decide which operations you're allowed to
reorder. :-) I suppose, thinking about it, that some techniques can be
taken from polymorphic virus writing.
