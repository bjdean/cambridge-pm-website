Woo, a new subscriber.

Perl[1] is fun, yes. Network design ought to be, but I'm currently trying to
renumber and restructure my home network without shutting down any machines,
and also moving to having a defaultless core (all routes being advertised by
RIP).

[1] with that capitalisation, please. :-) the reason being that PERL is what
    bad webmonkeys &quot;programme&quot; in.[2]
[2] me, snobbish? never!

This list has been a bit quiet recently, unfortunately, but then I know that
I haven't done much interesting in Perl recently, I'm not that interested in
the project I'm currently doing at work, though the one that might come up
soon looks exceedingly cool. I'll probably end up using a fair bit of Perl/Tk
for that.

Anyway, Lucy, what this means is that you need to organise another social
meeting.
