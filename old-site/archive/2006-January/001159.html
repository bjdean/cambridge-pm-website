The Carlton is quite nice (last time I was there was with the esteemed
Mr. Cozens.) If I don't go home first, I can lift one person in my car,
she only being a wee thing. If I do go home, I can take four more with
me. So if lifts were wanted, I could oblige. Though, come on, it isn't
*that* far out, is it?
