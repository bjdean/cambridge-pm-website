Haven't played with Amanda.

This might help a bit with that...
<A HREF="http://www.t8o.org/~mca1001/cgi/viewcvs/bin/sort_revname.pl">http://www.t8o.org/~mca1001/cgi/viewcvs/bin/sort_revname.pl</A>

The basic plan is to sort the list of filenames before you make the
tarball.  Put all the CVS/Root files together, all the Makefiles
together, more specifically all the fooproj/Makefiles closer than the
other ones...

It could be generally useful for repeated copies of files when they
have the same names.  For CVS working copies, maybe you could do
clever stuff to record only the differences from a clean checkout, but
this sounds like Work.

&gt;<i> - but some of the files are very large (although none over 2Gb yet)
</I>
Filename sorting won't help much here!  Maybe some filter between tar
and gzip that can do rolling checksums the way rsync does...

&gt;<i> - total area is up to about 250Gb
</I>&gt;<i> - we want to fit as much of that as possible onto one 20/40Gb tape
</I>
Do you define &quot;much&quot; by uncompressed size, number of files, number of
users with complete copies...?

&gt;<i> - we want users to be able to select what gets backed up, defaulting
</I>&gt;<i> to on
</I>
Another filename filter then?  Configured by dotfiles per directory or
one off?

Will the users be happy with writing a ~/.backup-list.pl script which
generates the filename list for what to include?  That's the ultimate
flexibility, and trustworthy if you su per user and maybe post-filter
the output.

&gt;<i> - we want to identify users with disproportionate backup requirements
</I>&gt;<i> - maybe implement quotas on the above
</I>
Quota by compressed size?  Ouch.  8-/

Especially if the files are sorted to put ~fred/cvswork/wibble.dat
right next to ~bill/cvswork/wibble.dat .

&gt;<i> I had the idea to deduplicate files on the tape by e.g. MD5sum. But
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know of a standard archive format that supports that.
</I>
Nor me.  You could big-bodge it by pretending the identical files are
hard linked, but then there's chaos if you unpack the thing without
undoing that.

&gt;<i> Ideally I'd like the tape format to be reconstructable with standard
</I>&gt;<i> tools for obvious reasons. Failing that, I'll stick a copy of the
</I>&gt;<i> restore script on the front of every tape.
</I>
An rsync-algorithm based stream de-duper sounds quite useful.  If you
made a good one it could be a standard.  8-)

&gt;<i> Anyone want to post their backup script that does anything like
</I>&gt;<i> this? Or want to offer advice on how to proceed?
</I>
Advice not entirely from my armchair.  I hope you can find something
useful in there.
