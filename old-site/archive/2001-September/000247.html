One possibility is of course to leave the nasty CPU intensive stuff in
some other language and then call it from a scriptable language like
perl.  Whether you do this as something like a swig of XS perl module,
or embed some other interpreter such as tcl in your C/C++ program is
more or less up to you.

Although I haven't written any code this way ye, I use a number of
scientific apps that do work this way, and they're a joy to automate as
a result - e.g tcl scripts driving automated DNA sequence assembly with
the Staden package.

It's quite a bit more painful to do this sort of thing with
non-scriptable alternatives like phrap, which is a shame because it's a
better assembly engine.

Tim.
