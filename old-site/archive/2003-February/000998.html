I've been pondering that as well - I think it must be the cold weather ('twas
-6C last night) slowing everyone down :)

How about we use the Carlton Arms this time ? Has the advantage of a
non-smoking lounge bar completely separate to the public bar and which has
nice comfortable sofa-type-things. Its owned by someone from CAMRA which
should give you an idea of the sort of beer available :)

The only downside is that they don't do food yet (should do RSN apparently).

[The fact that its also the closest pub to both myself and Lucy's place is]
[by-the-by as well :)                                                     ]
