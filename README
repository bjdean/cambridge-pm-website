This is going to be the place that the cambridge-pm website source is maintained.

I'm just setting things up at the moment. When I have a dump of the source I'll
import it and we'll be underway.

This project uses git for change control. To work on the source code:

    * Register for an account on http://github.com/

    * Grab the latest copy of the repository.  With git you can
      use:

        git clone git://github.com/bjdean/cambridge-pm-website.git 

      If you've got your commit-bit already, you can use:

        git clone git@github.com:bjdean/cambridge-pm-website.git 

      If you're working without git, you can download the master
      branch files at:

        http://github.com/bjdean/cambridge-pm-website/tarball/master

    * Do all your work on the a branch.

      If you're working on an already existing branch check it out
      as follows:

        git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name
        git merge master
        git push origin branch-name

      Replace branch-name with the branch name.  The 'git merge master' will
      make sure you've got the latest changes.  The push line will make sure
      your changes go back to the main repo.

      To create a new branch:

        git checkout master
        git pull
        git branch branch-name
        git push origin branch-name
