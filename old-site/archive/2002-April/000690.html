Quite a lot, if the program is going to produce a lot of output.  The
number of times I've seen people do this:

$foo=`some command`;  # or array context if they have a tad more clue

@stuff = split(/\n/, $foo);

foreach (@stuff) {
}

is really scary.  The main problem with backticks is that your perl
script has to gather all the data before it can act on any of it.  This
(a) consumes lots of memory and (b) destroys any parallelism you might
be able to get out of the pipe.

Far nicer to do something like this:

use IO::File;

my $fh = new IO::File;

$fh-&gt;open(&quot;some command|&quot;) or die &quot;Could not open pipe : $!\n&quot;;

while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
}

$fh-&gt;close;

If you need to fire of several of these then you need to either fork
your perl process, or use select() to poll for which file handles have
data available to read.  See the perlipc man page for details (as has
been suggested elsewhere).

Tim.
