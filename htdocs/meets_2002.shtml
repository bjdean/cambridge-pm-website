I was ill and in bed. I presume other people went though.

A change of pub saw us relocate across the road from the <a
href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=544565&Y=259148&A=Y&Z=1">Castle</a>
to the <a
href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?P2M?P=CB30AH&Z=1">County
Arms</a>. This was not deemed to be the greatest success of all time
due to their oven not working (leading to all sorts of confusion over
food) and their beer running out at inopportune moments. Some of us
went for a curry, some of us didn't, the curry party returned, a
spring was played with (and eventually fixed, I think), we returned to
House!/Heresy and then I went home for an early night.

Don't know. I wasn't there and nobody else wrote a report. Also, there
is no truth whatsoever in the rumours that I was singing Karaoke in
college instead.

In an attempt to meet Dan `<a
href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/">perl6-internals</a>'
Sugalski whilst he was in Cambridge, we rearranged to a Monday
night. Unfortunately, last minute changes in plans meant Dan couldn't
make it, so we were left with the locals and a couple of raiders from
London and Australia. Quotes of the evening:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>"So I had an interesting time at the Brazilian Consulate on
     Friday..." (Stephen Turner)</li>
 <li>"It's not en croute, more croute on the side." (Stephen Turner
     again)</li>
 <li>"I'm deprived." (Lucy McWilliam. Probably funnier at the time...)
</ul>
<p>
Fun was had, and many hangovers acquired thanks to Ian's
post-Post-Pizza presence at House! with port...

<p>
To celebrate one year's worth of cam.pm social meets, we returned to
our old haunt of The Castle, where we were joined by one new face in
the form of Simon Burr. Other than that, things were much as
usual. Memo to self: must think of more interesting things to say in
meet reports.
</p>
<p>

Once again in the Maypole, we congregated around a small table and
attempted to analyse Damien Conway's "Extreme Perl". We concluded that
Damien was a very clever man. After that, lots of people turned up and
we couldn't fit them all round the table. However, <a
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/13/2348209">figuring
you can never get too much Ian Jackson</a> (<tt>:-)</tt>), we obtained
him a stool from a mysterious pile in the corner and carried
on. Later, the traditional trip from the pub to House! was interrupted
only by a brief interlude whilst Markus Kuhn followed the wrong bike
at the traffic lights and almost got lost, prompting the formation of
an impromptu search party. It was quickly determined that he had been
collected by the walking party, and we were joined by Colin's
<i>very</i> nice whisky...
</p>
<p>

<p>
In a radical break with tradition, we moved from the Castle to <a
href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?P2M?P=CB58AF&Z=1">The
Maypole</a>. Pretty quiet really, but this may be more to do with a cold
outbreak that was going round Cambridge at the time, rather than
anything to do with our choice of pub.

<p>

This one began with the same people as usual, but seemed to be dominated
more and more by people I hadn't met before (one of whom seemed to have
been told various stories about me...) as the evening went on, and I'm not
sure how many of them are actually subscribed to the list anyway. Not
that we're complaining, as it was fun anyway...
</p>
<p>

In keeping with the norm, the usual suspects turned up to the Castle,
partook of food and beverages, retired to House! and generally had
fun. There was a <a href="archive/2002-April/000681.html">brief
discussion</a> (apologies for Mailman's sucky threading) on the list
about alternatives to the Castle for meets, but nobody came up with
any concrete suggestions...
</p>
<p>
 <b><a name="20020308">Friday 2002-03-08</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Well, this one must have happened but nobody wrote a report on it, and
it's now a month later and I've completely forgotten if anything
interesting happened. Oh well...
</p>
<p>

<p>
An impromptu meet inspired by <a
href="archive/2002-February/000578.html">Tony's post</a>, we went to the
Castle to meet Simon Wilcox. Unfortunately, he couldn't find us (this
appears to be a recurring theme <tt>:-(</tt>), so we had to make do with
the company of <a href="http://www.cucs.ucam.org/">CUCS</a> who were
(not <i>entirely</i> coincidentally) also having a social meet in the
Castle. Much was discussed, much was consumed and I got to bed too late
again.
</p>
<p>
 <b><a name="20020213">Wednesday 2002-02-13</a></b>
</p>
<p>
A slightly different plan for this social: due to the fact that Dave
Green (of <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">NTK</a> fame) was speaking to
the <a href="http://www.cucs.ucam.org/">Cambridge University Computer
Society</a> on this evening, we planned to meet in the <a
href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=544553&Y=257960&A=Y&Z=1">Anchor,
Silver Street</a>, head off to see Dave's talk and then to adjourn to
a public house afterwards.
</p>
<p>
What actually happened, I don't know as I wasn't there and nobody
posted any details to the list...
</p>
<p>
 <b><a name="20020125">Friday 2002-01-25</a></b>
</p>
<p>
It happened. Nobody wrote a report, so you'll just have to turn up to
the next one if you want see what they're like.
