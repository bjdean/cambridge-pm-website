He might be on holiday.  Give him *at least* a month before assuming
something is wrong.

&gt;<i> I'd like some advice on what to do next. Should I give in and just keep
</I>&gt;<i> the fix to myself?
</I>
Apply the fix locally, post it to rt.cpan so that other people can
benefit.

&gt;<i>                    Should I try to find another way of contacting the
</I>&gt;<i> author?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>         Should I write a bad review on cpanratings?
</I>
No.  Failure to respond to an email in a short period of time is not
something that you should criticise in someone who is giving you their
stuff for free.

&gt;<i>                                                     Should I distribute
</I>&gt;<i> the patch on my website and hope people find it?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>                                                   Should I upload a
</I>&gt;<i> rival module to CPAN?
</I>
No.

I'd prod the guy after a month, and again a month later, and a month
after that, and if he's still not responded I'd mumble at the modules
mailing list and ask someone with the necessary privs to make me a
co-maintainer so I can upload a fixed version to the CPAN.

That's basically what I did with Data::Compare.
