<PRE>The denizens of the as-yet-unnamed structure currently residing at
11 Atherton Close, Cambridge invite you to aid us in our quest to alter
the ambient temperature of said structure (we would suggest house-warming,
but it's still summer and we'd prefer it if you cooled it instead)
on Saturday 1st September 2001 at party o'clock.

Directions for the directionally-challenged: starting from Mitcham's
Corner, proceed in a leisurely fashion northwards along Milton Road, and
turn left down Ascham Road (the 3rd left if you count the Westbrook Centre
and the 2nd left if you don't). There's a library on the corner for ease of
identification and emergency book supplies. Turn right into Atherton Close
then left onto the large gravelly bit and we're in the far right corner. If
you get lost, phone us (01223 356412) so we can share in your bewilderment
(and possibly provide additional directions).

PBAB, PBAF, PB interesting things to eat, PB offerings to the god of
bookcases.  Featuring the party attic.  Limited parking/crash space
available.
