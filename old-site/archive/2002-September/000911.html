&quot;Welcome.  Do you use perl to do chemistry?  Everyone else is being quiet, 
and some of us are recovering from YAPC::Europe.&quot;

I would have like to have done, given that my master's project was on the 
use of web-accessible databases in chemistry - including building one - but 
I was forced to use PHP instead because the maintainer (my tutor) didn't 
know Perl and didn't see any particular reason to bother learning it 
(sigh...)

I mostly fool around with Perl for a bit of fun: The last thing I wrote was 
a cobbled-together &lt;a 
href='<A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=194335'">http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=194335'</A>&gt;Texas Hold 'ems 
tool&lt;/a&gt;, which told you how likely you were to win with a given hand. I've 
rewritten it as an object-oriented module, which removed most of the nasty 
cruft and it reads much better now.
