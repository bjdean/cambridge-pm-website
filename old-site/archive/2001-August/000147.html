&gt;<i> [1] And on more than once occasion that call has consisted of

I attach my CV as plain text. Had an agent claim he couldn't read it
because it might contain a virus.

&gt;<i> [2] Yes, my CV is distributed in PDF. I find that best as that
</I>&gt;<i> stops agencies from editing it. This causes massive confusion
</I>&gt;<i> to agents and on occasion they've even resorted to either a)
</I>&gt;<i> copying the text and pasting it into Word or b) retypoing it
</I>&gt;<i> from scratch.
</I>
I'm sort of tempted to do something like:

This CV copyright 1994-2001 Piers Cawley &lt;<A HREF="mailto:pdcawley@iterative-software.com">pdcawley@iterative-software.com</A>&gt;
You are licensed to pass verbatim copies of this CV to prospective clients.
You are not licensed to make any alterations, nor to convert it to any
other format.

at the bottom of mine. But with the market like it is, I don't want to
come across as stroppy.
