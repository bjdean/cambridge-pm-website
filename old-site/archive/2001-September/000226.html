I just tried it with:

#! /usr/bin/perl -w

sub recurse ($)
{
    print &quot;$_[0] &quot;;
    recurse ($_[0] + 1);
}

recurse 0;

It seems only to warn (&quot;Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;main::recurse&quot; at
./recurse.pl line 6.&quot;). At &gt;200000 levels of recursion, though, it was
taking up ~80Mb of memory just with stack frames.

I'd agree with that. You can unfold any recursion into iteration
(trivially, using your own stack, or perhaps in some cleverer way).
Recursive code is often very elegant and easy to understand, but at that
kind of depth it's unlikely to be efficient unless the language is built
for it.

Since Perl didn't optimize away the tail-recursion in my code above, I'd
guess that it's not the best language to use for deeply recursive code.
