Is there an algorithmic description of when terms start? I know that
the Michaelmas term usually starts on the first Thursday in October,
but Easter causes amusing havoc with the Lent and Easter terms, both
Full Term and Term in the longer sense (er, ENOENT for the name).

I recently bought a facinating book called &quot;Calendrical Calculations&quot;
published by CU Press, which contains Lisp code for lots of weird
and wonderful calendars as well as common-or-garden ones, so fitting
University terms into its framework would seem to be a good project.
(It's also missing the Shire Reckoning, which seems to be a dire
omission, especially since (despite its seeming simplicity) it has
some unique features.) I think the Oxford Companion to the Year
will have to be acquired to keep it company on the shelf...

Tony.
