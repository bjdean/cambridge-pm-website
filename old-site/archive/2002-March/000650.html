I went to look for perl to download.  Following the advice in the Camel
book I went to www.perl.org and and the obvious thing to do there was
click on the big shiny download button.  This took me to www.cpan.org.
Knowing I wanted to roll my own I clicked on the &quot;source code&quot; link.
This has links for the stable release and the current development
release and says about the latter:

&quot;Source code for the latest development release of perl. This code has
new features and bug fixes relative to the version in stable.tar.gz;
however, it has not been in use for so long, and so has more bugs that
we do not know about. If this does not worry you, this is the version
for you. If it does worry you, then you need stable.tar.gz.&quot;

Which says to me immediately (under my circumstances) &quot;do not use&quot;.  It
would be here that I'd expect instead a statement of the fact that while
5.6.1 was the current stable release 5.8.whatever was due any minute now
and you ought to test the development version to make sure it wouldn't
break your code.

Where do you expect me to find this out otherwise if I'm not reading
cam.pm?  I don't think I'm being unreasonable here.
