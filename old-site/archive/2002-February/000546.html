<PRE>&gt;<i> I've never actually done anything with Per/Tk.  What's it like?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I have used it (with/via GLADE) to protoype a user interface and it was
good for that.

I wouldn't have done it without using Glade, since that handles all of
the UI design stuff for you and just spits out the UI code which you
then don't have to touch.

Drawing to the canvas widget is very slow, so wouldn't use it for
anything that needs fast graphics, but great for a small app such as a
UI front end to a command line or a config tool.

R.
