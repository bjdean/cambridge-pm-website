They don't just need Damians. It appears that Damian is helping Larry a lot
with the language design, but he's not doing any of the underlying
implementation. We probably need to clone lots more Dan Susalskis, and I'd
guess that a few more Jarkkos wouldn't go amiss.

Anyway, Damian is Australian, Jarkko is Finnish, so hopefully there shouldn't
be a problem with them.

PS Off topic - ACME Klein Bottle are holding a competition, with Klein bottles
   (and hats) as prizes:
   <A HREF="http://www.kleinbottle.com/m%26ms_in_a_klein_bottle.htm">http://www.kleinbottle.com/m%26ms_in_a_klein_bottle.htm</A>
   (hmm. or is this list full of Bio-informaticists who wouldn't appreciate a
    Klein bottle full of M&amp;Ms)
