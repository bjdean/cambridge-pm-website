It was mentioned on use.perl.org:

<A HREF="http://use.perl.org/articles/02/03/05/1235220.shtml?tid=6">http://use.perl.org/articles/02/03/05/1235220.shtml?tid=6</A>

    This is the last developer release before the major release of
    5.8.0 in April or May,

and I believe in the perl.com e-mail newsletter (although I've deleted my
copy of that, as usual)

It also got to slashdot:
<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/05/2041239&mode=thread">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/05/2041239&amp;mode=thread</A>

    Perl 5.7.3 is out. This should be the last development version
    before 5.8.0 comes out in April or May.

The proposed schedule for 5.8 was also debated a bit about 2 weeks before,
and again (I think) mentioned on use.perl.org

But I agree that that's not everywhere.

&gt;<i> I'm certainly not installing development versions at work anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It would be really useful if everyone on cam.pm could test 5.7.3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I could install it at home, but that really wouldn't be much of a
</I>&gt;<i> test since I never write perl at home to a first approximation.
</I>
No. Sorry if this is sounding rude. What I am trying to say is:

Either: Install it somewhere at work on a development system
        Test works scripts with it
Or:	Do not complain if it turns out that 5.8 does not run work's
        scripts.

(Sorry. that was a rude way of putting it)

The polite way is:

perl needs your help. 5.7.3 is almost 5.8. Please, if you are able, find out
whether 5.7.3 breaks the perl scripts and modules you rely on. If you report
problems now, they can be fixed before 5.8

If you report the problems with 5.8, you'll have to wait until 5.8.1

It's probably best to read the instructions:

<A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg74215.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg74215.html</A>

I'll forward the &quot;Internet way&quot; to the list.
